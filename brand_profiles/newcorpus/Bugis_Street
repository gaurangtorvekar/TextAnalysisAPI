Our hotel concierge advised us to go to Bugis street.it was very nice advice as my wife shopped a lot and I paid reasonably.in our next visit to Singapore ,we will spend more time in Bugis street.

We heard from someone about Bugis Junction, So we went there. While walking, we saw this street. We started walking inside it and surprisingly it was really very big. We shopped a lot. We spent around 6 hours here. My wife went to every shop and she always found something new to buy. Really great market.

If you are in the neighbourhood it is well worth visiting for the hustle and bustle of a street market. Be wary of pickpockets.

You could find almost everything from this place, and a great shopping area to find cheap souvenirs. you could find 4 for $10 t-shirts, keychain and any other stuffs which mostly sold 3 for $10. Prepare yourself to get sweaty though..

Bags, sun glasses, souvenirs and many stuffs with affordable price. 24 prices of Singapore iconic keychain only for 10SGD, 4 handbags also 10SGD. Try to going around this street before decide which shop that have a good deal for you (good quality with affordable price).

Imagine your local major flea market, then double its size and treble the number of customers. Yes, there is bucketloads of stuff to buy (occidentals will struggle to be the right size for clothing), but remember it is a flea market; quality will be difficult to find.

This is a nice place to get cheap stuff but it's too hot and stuffy. The crowd gets worst during weekends. So expect thousand of people and a big squeeze. Come prepared to sweat and getting the heat!
Would be really nice of its cooler.

Loved these markets. Visited them twice as it was hard to get it all in on one go. They do get very crowded though so can be difficult for families with small children and prams. Everything from fashion, souvenirs and food. A must see.

my favorite block in singapore hands down. Visited here first in 2011, then came back last month to find out it's now bigger than before. For people who has anxiety among crowds, I don't recommend this. but for those who have no problem moving back and forth in tiny space crowded with people, then this is it. Found the cheap...


One of the most important stuff to bring back home whenever you are on a holiday is souvenir; be it fridge magnet, key-chain, t-shirt etc. and I bet this place is among the favorite spot by many tourists who visited Singapore. Every souvenirs you can find in one (crowded) place. Easy access via the MRT and a proper Hylam Mall...


Bugis Street is a unique retail shopping destination. After undergoing a major facelift, Bugis Street now houses almost 800 shops, making it the largest street shopping location in Singapore. With a vast and dynamic product mix, Bugis Street is well known for its wide selection, competitive prices and quality merchandise that cater to anyone and everyone. The entire street came...


Really lovely place to shop! Compared to malls, this is fairly cheaper. I bought all my stuff here, with the exception of some stuff from Typo store.
Highly recommended to budget travelers! But before you buy anything, make sure to check each stall first! That's what I did, and good thing I did that because I saw cheaper version of...


If you are looking for women's fashion it's great, if you are slim. You are not able to try anything on which makes it difficult. The prices are cheap so it's not a big loss if you buy something you can't wear. My husband was disappointed because there were not many places to buy mens clothing and it was all...


It is a shoppers paradise. Absolutely loved it!!! All local stuff at really cheap prices. But the quality is great.
Its a huge huge market so look out for every turn you take. I was lost.

This marketplace was air conditioned which surprised me as most markets do not have air conditioning. This market caters for young girls fashion (mostly all one size fits all) and some men's clothing but bare in mind, they have a policy where you cannot try it on. There are heaps of cheap souvenirs and the fresh juice is really cheap...


Bugis street is now one massive indoor market place selling nearly everything you can think of. many many stalls of souvenirs, much like China town (3 for $10) and also many stalls for clothing.
if you don't like massive crowds or shopping its probably not somewhere you should go.

Bugis is Harajuku - Singapore version, in here u must slight to choose what ever u buy...
sometimes is more expensive than usually, so u must bargain as u can , example for the dress them hang in the price is SGD 10 , u can less it like SGD 8 .. the cheapest store in ground , the ground...


Bugis Street is one massive indoor flea market, spanning 3 floors across two buildings. Most of it is indoor and air conditioned, but some stalls have spilled out and over into the adjacent buildings and roads. There are some souvenir stalls along the first floor, but majority of the stalls here cater to young girls' fashion. Most novelty items can...


many merchandise you can choose here e.g watch, umbrella, clothes, keychain, etc. They also sell snacks if you hungry or fast food restaurant when you walk out here and it only take 3 or 4 minutes to get there.

Visited during the day in July about 36 degrees which means it was very hot inside! this market sells all matter of things but lots of stalls selling the same items! some good fashion for the youngies as long as you are a small size. Lots of junky souvenir items, such as key holders etc. nothing of quality available from...


This place is located at the center of Singapore. One can enjoy the Street Shopping and can taste the different different cuisines of Singapore. This place a mixture of Shopping and Food Chains. One of happening place of Singapore.

The quality are better than mong Kok in hong kong. Ppl seems nicer and more comfortable than in mong kok hong kong .Price reasonable for these quality. If you want fitting room and service then go in shopping arcade . This is not what you will like. I am small build so size general ok.

i avoided the much hyped Mustafa for obvious reasons that Im not good at bargaianing. Most shops in bugis street have fixed rates and you dont feel cheated. Good ladies tops,purse available in the range of $12-20. Lots of studd in $2 to 5 range to be acrried as souveniers for folks in India

What a heaven market. Everything is cheap for souvenir.
Crowded like other market.
Stop and buy some uncle ice cream! Just 1$ to accompanying your shopping!

Was disappointed with Bugis St. The noise was a cacophony, the market stalls were all virtually 'one size fits my 5ft tweenage daughter' and nowhere to try any clothes on if you did happen to find something you might like to purchase.

Bugis street are just outside Bugis MRT. This is at its peak in the nights. Small street shops full of variety specially young girls cloths, accessories and suitable place for buying cheap Singapore souvenirs. My kids bought wrist watches and key rings. Garments have a lot of variety but a bit small for average Indian standards & also a bit...


Very busy market area, loads of the same and would appear all prices fixed, no real bartering (better in China town KL). Couldn't find the dodgy handbags/shoes/watches. Eating at the hawkers dinners is an experience worth having.

Economic shopping point in singapore, nice place to hang out with friends, god food places around, with a blessed McD at the MRT of bugis, subway is the good option at bugis mall, walled with hotel intercontinental

One of the many indoor and street shopping/retail in Singapore. Crowded with people and shopper bargaining a highlight, if you are up to it. Anything and everything you might be interested in buying. If you a shopper and bargain hunter, this might be your cup of tea. You can purchase t-shirts to tailored suits and souvenirs.

A must do in Singapore is to visit the Bugis street markets. Here you will find pretty much any knick knack item that you will need. There are a lot of the same stalls selling the same thing so it does get a little repetitious. If you need to buy a lot of souvernirs for family and friends when you...


We had not really heard of Bugis St before going to Singapore - unlike the more famous Orchard Road. However, we did our best shopping here. Great malls and clothing shops - as well as nice places to eat. Worth the short MRT ride from City Hall. We found the shopping better than Orchard Road which tends to have a...


As far as shopping goes, it's hard to beat. You have an area with a China-town like vibe (and pricing), a hawker area, while on the other end there are the posh malls. A few blocks away are the art and music shops. It can get crowded, though.

We visited in the evening and it was initially a shock the sheer number of people - but this paled into insignificance compared to just how much stuff is crammed in there.
It is not an architecturally inspired building nor, I imagine, it is up there with the cultural highs of Singapore but nonetheless it was interesting/enjoyable and we picked...


A lively colourful market area full of smells especially "Durian" fruit not everyone's dream but it is part of any market in Singapore. So many places selling clothes, all kinds of street food & juices, a riot of noise colour not a place a for a gentle stroll, more a place to absorb the atmosphere. In January like all places...


One may read about the history of Bugis Street in the Wikipedia article of the same name, and in a number of Weblogs recalling history (and personal histories) associated with the original Bugis Street. The original Bugis Street was a unique "walking street" for eating, drinking, and people-watching. Arguably one of "the things to do in Singapore" in the 1960s...


This is where we bought souvenirs to bring home. T shirts, key chains, ash trays with singapore designs, magnets.

I liked this street as it is close to Bugis Junction mall, and Bugis Traditional Market which sale many souvenirs of Singapore icon. So, for people whose like shopping, this place really recommended for you and also there are so many hotel here. I disliked for the crowded situation and abit traffic.

Pretty much has everything you are looking for. Can be a tight squeeze through as it can be very packed by both people looking and stall holders themselves. Never really saw a 'quiet time' Was staying at a hotel opposite and went through a few different times of day and was generally packed.
Worth going too for those tat souvenirs...


I found the place very average. Average stalls, average prices, averagely kept, stall holders average. A bit disappointment really. Enough said.

A lot of very cheap clothes and souvenirs
Very manic on the weekends but still an experience. Get some cash before you got through the markets as everything is cash.
Good street style food and juice bars.
It's an experience worth doing and it's full of clothes for the kids and women not so much for guys.
Try to go...


This place is packed however a must visit for anyone visiting singapore. Its an experience. Very busy all the time. Some great souvenirs available at great prices.

Check out the map and you will see there are plenty of places to visit after you have passed bugis street. For instance, there's the famous local temple, called the Guan Yin Temple. The new shopping mall Bugis + ( can catch a movie there, or drink a cup of koi bubble tea ). Then walk a little further to...


If you look for souvenirs of singapore with a good price, come to Bugis street. Although the quality is not great but can't say bad. It is OK if you need to buy lots of souvenirs.
When the first time I visited Bugis street back to 10-15 years ago, I even could bargain to 40% discount. However the last visit...


The place is small, then it's so crowded and if you are budget shopper, it's a good choice to shop there, and you can buy souvenir there ( there's a lot of promotion ). But, if you don't like to shop or sightseeing in crowded place, better find other place to shop

We chose to stay near Bugis Village since we live to shop for cheap but nice stuff. There are plenty of shops which sells nice and funky clothes as well as shoes and sandals. Since my kids are teen agers and shopping at Orchard Road is quite expensive, this place is a good alternative. When taking the MRT, alight at...


Bugis street is right outside Bugis Station. So train is the best mode of travel. Around 800 shops under one roof and a huge range of variety is available for shoppers.
Best time to visit is around 11am since it is not that crowded. Have a look at everything first and then decide to buy. Same product will have different...


Great undercover airconditioned market place selling lots of cheap goods and many souvenirs. Great atmosphere although a bit crowded. Worth a visit for sure!

Last time I was in Bugis srt, was in 59 and 62. what a change, it was full of ladies, trouble was you couldn't tell the difference, between a real one or a ladyboy, unless you did a mick dundee

Bugis street, i can spend my whole afternoon here looking for souvenirs and cute accessories. However, i find the souvenir (fridge or key chain) cheaper in Chinatown. You may also walk to the Guan Yin temple and do some prayer.

We love Bugis,stay in Sing for 5 days , came here 7 times, I have my first tatoo here, we have been offer really Big promotion when shopping in Bugis+. We are broke now .

It was a bit interesting, but it's very crowded and they mainly sell cheap junk and fakes. made in China", silly statement t-shirts sayng things like "University of Michigan Goldfish", also the ware is quite repetitive. Most of the stuff is "one size fits all", and they don't let you try it, but those sizes are for asians, and looked...


Bugis has always been a place for everyone. The unique fountain entertain the kids, shop as much as you can with better deals or simply hang out to kill your time. We have always had fun enjoying the water fountain, getting wet and watching kids place around.

The place to go for local sites and shopping of all sorts. I go there for the fresh market and rocks and minerals stores

This place is not hard to find ;). If you are a budget-conscious tourist, this is the place for you! This is like 168 shopping plaza in the Philippines where you can find and buy various
things like cheap bags; t-shirts, caps, sun
glasses. Though you could find there some
branded stores also that suits your taste! ;)

This is one of the liveliest and busy shopping area, which I came across. A complete paradise for people who love to shop and bargain. You can find anything and everything here with repeated shops and different variety. A lot of discounts were going on, when I visited and picked up quite a few things for gifting apart from shopping...


A shopping heaven, Bugis Village has everything from clothing, jeans, accessories, even adult shop. Variety of food and drinks also available and

This is the liviest shopping street in Singapore , you can find everything from clothing ,wathes , cosmetics, foods and drinks , frankly speaking almost anything with bargainable price.Its a 4 storey street mall and you all shops from bottom to top have a distictive merchandise.Near to the Bugis Junction , Bugis + shopping mall.Accessible from any part of Singapore...


Interesting places to shop that sells a variety of goods ranging from souvenirs to clothes. Feel free to bargain to get the best price, if you are tired of shopping, there are also a lot of drink and snack vending. Maybe this is a paradise for shopping lovers. Located opposite and close enough to the MRT station, to be able...


If you like market shopping you will be disappointed, if you don't like market shopping don't even bother. Remember they don't open until 10-11 and its the same thing over and over again. Lots of watches, t shirts, hair accessories, and phone cases. There are a lot of food stalls which is probably the only good thing about it.

This was my first visit here and went there on tripadvisor recommendations but they didn't pay it justice. This is by far my favourite part of Singapore for shopping - beats the massive shopping centres!
The street has heaps of charm with really cool artisan, vintage boutiques. Some are a little pricey but most aren't and you won't find the...


Whether its cheaps watches, clothing or food you want, head to the Bugis Street Markets and wander through the back streets. Its amazing!

Bugis was right near our hotel, spent nearly every night there since it is open until 10-11pm.
Wonderful shopping for teens and 20 somethings, especially girls. If you can bargain this is the place for you, as well as an excellent place to pick up souvenirs.
Regarding the "no trying allowed"- ask nicely as they will often let westerners try...


Bugis Street is just what markets should be. Lots of variety and the option to barter if you want. It is even better now than it was a few years ago as they have improved the air circulation which makes it a little more comfortable. You can find just about most things you would want and the only place to...


This is the market which many many people are not aware about..We found this place when we are looking on net for shopping and thought of giving it a try..The market is quite shabby like Ladies market of Hongkong or Patpong of Bangkok,But then shopping for cheap is here...U can scroll about as its a huge market and bargaining at...


If you need to buy clothes for your teens or people back home bugis is the place to go. They do sell souvenirs in bulk like a price for 24 key chains but it works out almost the same as Chinatown.

Extensive markets in and around Bugis Street. Different to other Asian markets elsewhere in that quality was a little better, was air conditioned (to some degree anyway) and no bartering/bargaining. All clothes seemed to be aimed at <30 year olds though...very little for us 50 somethings. One unique and questionable aspect was that you were expected to purchase without trying...


Shopping street it is....... but its mainly for ladies........ So visit only if you plan to shop for women...... again you will get small souveniers and also choclates in here.........

We stayed at the intercontinental so had easy access to Bugis Street. The stalls and shops are open late with a great range of souvenirs. There are plenty of cheap T-shirts, shoes, clothes etc but if you are not interested in the cheap items then just go for the atmosphere. There are also department stores in the immediate vicinity so...


Nice night ambience , just like night market. I wanted to buy I <3 SG t-shirt but it was expensive , S$15 fixed price ! I didnt buy it , I just bought another cloth. And I found that Giordano sells the original I <3 SG t shirt for S$15 too. I was so glad i didnt buy at bugis...


Take the MRT to Bugis station and check out Bugis Village as I doubt that you would be too disappointed. Busy with many shopping, browsing, eating and drinking options. My fave was grabbing fresh fruit juices at good prices ($1 SGD) or sit down and have a mango smoothie at one of the cafes along the pedestrian strip which afford...


Fortunately we stopped here early afternoon and had a quick walk around the market. The guide books seem to rave about it but it is really tacky with nothing worth buying. Many more interesting places in Singapore.
The one saving grace was that we found a good food court just outside Bugis Street MRT

Had an amazing time shopping in this area. Please explore the whole market before buying anything as they have some amazing variety and some good deals . Do explore the kstree which is just above .

Very huge place for shopping cheap clothes, watches, sovereigner etc
The entire place cannot be covered in a day. BAWARE that the place is really crowded

I have visited the market several times for the buzz. Its always bright and colourful. However, there is nothing in my size - even Asian XL is at best a European L and often only M.

Crazy busy, especially at weekends but good fun. You can buy cheap souvenirs and clothing for next to nothing.

We were advised to visit China Town and Little India, however, after visiting both we weren't that impressed. We then stumbled upon Bugis markets suggested by a local, 3 stories spread over a few streets, great food, great sales and great attraction. The Markets are open all day long and close around 10pm at night, the food stalls carry on...


Spent a fair bit of time at Bugis Street. Certainly if I had an unlimited budget and no clothes I might have found it more interesting but apart from that it was just a nice place to walk through.

Decided to go here after hearing a lot from my friends. Well - for guys - better avoid, its a ladies shopping area and mostly sovereigns. if you are looking for cheap watches and fresh fruit drinks this is the place. Be prepared to face the rush as it gets crowded very soon especially on weekends. With my experience -...


Located in front of Bugis Junction Mall, Bugis street is easily accessible.
you can buy souvenirs and chlotes, bags etc. with a very cheap price.

A must for anyone looking for some cheap holiday souvenirs to take back home.
There are lots of little shops set out in little streets under cover so no matter what the weather is you can shop away.
We did not stop for food but there is lots available and if it tastes half as good as it looks and...


There are 3 major shopping centres here, BHG, OG n ILLUMA where they sell more good quality products. There have everything from fashion wear , daily necessaries to IT products, anything you can think of, they have it here. At Bugis Village, you can get souvenirs at $2, T-Shirt at 3 for $10, Tote Bag at 4 for $10, Summer...


really good market went there twice. I prefer market shopping than department store and this market had quality clothing and shoes. Cheap watches and jewellry and was able to buy here for everyone back home

We visited this market this morning and whilst is busy and at times congested it is really good for purchasing souvenirs, presents for friends, with a large range of different stores all selling earrings, bags, Jewellery, cheap perfumes, electronic gadgets and accessories, cold juices etc... Really enjoyed buying some souvenirs to take home but you need time out afterwards! Te...


I obviously knew how expensive Singapore would be but was still shocked by the prices. So it was a welcomed surprised stumbling upon the Bugis street market with a variety of clothes, shoes, souvenirs, and other stuff that were more reasonably priced

We spent a couple of hours in these markets and didn't get to see it all. Prices are great. Good quality souvenir t-shirts for $10, or keyrings for $2 (the same they sell elsewhere for $6). If you want to supply your friends and family with souvenirs here is where you can achieve that on a budget. Oh - and...


Refreshing fruit juices available at only $1. Many shops selling clothes (as low as $5), accessories, shoes, souvenirs etc etc. Drop by if you'd like to get cheap souvenirs and clothings.

There are a lot of shopping malls in Singapore but Bugis is where you can find cheap but good finds. It is also near some hawker centers where you can eat authentic Singaporean food at an affordable price (way better than those at malls). Be ready though to walk and face the crazy crowd.

Its a place where you can get cheap and best. Get good souvenir . Bit crowded though.. Its jus outside green line and its very close to purple line as well. Shopping area. Have lots of manicurist and retail shop around.

I wouldnt say this market wasn't anything too exciting if you've done classic markets in other Asian cities yet isn't bad to check out.
We went around 8.45pm to pick up some hawkers food for a late dinner at the same time but a few of the stalls had shut up by then and a large portion of the food...


Nothing special here. If you're from Jakarta, I could describe it more like "mangga dua". here's a place to shop. Either it's cloth, choco, or just eating food around. Nothing special to show..
Not really recommended for babies, cos it's very crowded... Hot, and none AC..

This is obviously is the most famous recommended shopping area for tourists who are seeking for things to bring back home as a keepsake for their loved-ones. This is the place where you can get tons of Singapore keychains at a very low price (frugal as you may be). TIP: shop around first and go for the lowest deal you...


It is a amazing place to Shop as it is also called the biggest street market of Singapore. This is indeed a shopping paradise for girls as this street offers lots of good merchandise like clothes, dresses, accessories & other gift items with reasonable rates.
It is well connected to MRT, drop down at BUGIS station & 5 minutes walk...


3 floors of shop like markets. Better quality clothing than what is in the markets and lots of cheap dresses for small people like me. Will take you a good couple of hours to work your way around it. Everything is cram packed in, but make sure you barter cos you can oftern get good discounts for multi buys. Just...


It is as beautiful as chaotic, I love Bugis Street, I like his hustle his flea market where it can be found anything and for those like me who love tropical fruit really low prices.
It is not only fruit, but there is really everything, including the dozens of stalls along the way.
This is one of those typical Asian...


This is an area of mix shopping. Value for money for young and trendy, tourist as well as locals. There are many shops around here which you can pick your choices. Food is ample here and it is conveniently next to the Bugis MRT station. Spent at least 3 hours here.

Mostly cheap and low quality clothing. Suitable place to shop for party gear. A lot of touristy stuff on ground floor and low quality snacks and food aligning the pathway.
Really cramp premises and the ventilation is terrible. Almost impossible to navigate during weekends.
Should go to the adjacent mall or Bugis Junction for decent air-conditioning on a hot day...


It is average for shopping.
I expected more but this complex has about 3 storey.
Nothing much if compared to shopping experience in Seoul or Malaysia.
The prices were a bit expensive. Of course if you walk the whole building you will be able to find some cheap stuff as well.
The location is very good near to the subway....


Bustling undercover Market selling lots of touristy tat, worth a visit but don't expect any fakes or it to be like markets in Hong Kong or Thailand.. Spent an hour here just walking through then trying to find my way back to my starting point... it was packed

Bugis Village is a place where you can do shopping for cheap prices compared to other places in Singapore. With a vast and dynamic product mix, Bugis Street is well known for its wide selection, competitive prices and quality merchandise that cater to anyone and everyone.
Bugis Street currently houses about 800 shops, which makes Bugis Street the Largest Street...


Since our hotel was located in between Little India and Bugis junction, we got to see both Little India and Bugis Village. I would describe this is more a residential area, where you can buy cheaper clothing, there are many shops and restaurants, also a huge food court that seems to be very inexpensive comparing to few other we visited,...


Went to Bugis village this june school holidays to purchase Vans shoes. As usual, it is quite a good plce to shop and lot of choices to eat.

If you dont want to shop then definitely dont go. Lots of small shops with lots of bargins.
You can also buy food items and other things you may need if you are staying a while.

Fun, full on, busy, frenetic, cheap no major shops just lots of small shops. Better atmosphere that the big sterile malls.
Spent a lot of time wandering around.

what do you do if you're a shopaholic, but on a limited budget in expensive singapore? You go to bugis, of course! Bugis is for shopaholic bargain hunters like me who get their thrills from cheapo finds and who'd sacrifice anything in the shopping--crowds, sweat, you name it! My measly shopping budget would have never survived without bugis. Orchard road...


A nice bargain shopping area worth a look. Theres also a nice chinese cuisine food court across the road.

This was a first time, i visit Bugis Street. SO excited with all the cheap goods. clothes basically are cheap. about 10-30 dollar. depend on the design and material. basically, if you can tolerate cheap goods with average quality of material, you should visit this place. it's not for people who love designer and fancy expensive things. the quality is...


Lots and lots of tiny shops but mostly selling crap and high priced crap save your time don't bother going there.
Hot and smelly

Greta place to buy anything, it's all cheap so don't expect top quality, but it provides value for money. Also has great iced drinks for a $1,as well as food and fruit. This place has been on my Singapore to do list since I first went there in 1976 (changed a bit though!)

Got its name from the Bugis people from Sulawesi, Indonesia. It serve as a trading point of the Bugis, and thats how the name came about. This is flea market or a shopping mecca for all those cheap goods or item like fake watches and women handbags. A good place to get your souvenir for giveway.

A back-alley roadside vendor typed scene where the Bugis from South Sulawesi province, Indonesia would do their trading, in the olden days. This used to be a tourist destination those days during my younger days. Today, popular spot still, against all the bigger and sophisticated malls. As time goes the STB has done a lot to upkeep the place and...


Bugis Street Markets are very hot and crowded. Many stalls all selling the same thing - cheap quality womens clothing and mobile phone accessories. A good place to go for the experience, but if it is shopping you want - there is much better around.

Bugis Street is indeed Singapore's epicentre of (cheap) shopping, and is surely a must-visit.
Depending on where you are, you can take a cab, a bus (double-check the number), or an MRT. From the MRT, you will simply pass through the mall, and cross the street to Bugis/ There you will find many stalls offering various products to choose from:...


There were tons of stalls upon stalls here. It was also ridiculously crowded. It wasn't the cheapest place to go to for souvenirs but it sure was an experience to walk around in.

The ground level of the complex sell souvenirs and delicacies. Prices are a bit cheaper and there are a lot to choose from. The upper floor and the rest is technically a girl's place. Clothes, shoes, bags, u name it! However its not the cheapest market in Asia. Markets in China and Bangkok can let you save more money.

We frequent this place very often and have still not been able to try all of the food and shopping etc. there's so many different things to do here that I'm sure there is something for everyone

Got many stalls you can visit, especially souvenirs, phone casings, or bags! There also got many malls you may shop,go there early morning for the bugis street.

Take your time to go through all the shops in the bugis village and I am sure one can find what they are looking for, at a very cheap price. You can get watches and goggles for as low as $5 and t-shirts starting from $3. IT also has shops that sells items which are over $100 as well. So,...


It is located next to Bugis MRT station, hence the ease of accessibility to the area. The newly renovated bugis village offers great buys at affordable pricing, the improved ventilation makes shopping in the crowded area more comfortable.

Enjoy Bugis Street but do take the time to explore the upper floors of the complex. Down on street level, many of the shops offer the same touristy stuff. Well, that is why we are in Bugis. But, up the levels and the shopping becomes more real. You will spend more money on ground level on touristy things. Upstairs isn't...

Stop and buy some uncle ice cream! Just 1$ to accompanying your shopping!

If you are looking for women's fashion it's great, if you are slim. You are not able to try anything on which makes it difficult. The prices are cheap so it's not a big loss if you buy something you can't wear. My husband was disappointed because there were not many places to buy mens clothing and it was all...


It is a shoppers paradise. Absolutely loved it!!! All local stuff at really cheap prices. But the quality is great.
Its a huge huge market so look out for every turn you take. I was lost.

This marketplace was air conditioned which surprised me as most markets do not have air conditioning. This market caters for young girls fashion (mostly all one size fits all) and some men's clothing but bare in mind, they have a policy where you cannot try it on. There are heaps of cheap souvenirs and the fresh juice is really cheap...


Bugis street is now one massive indoor market place selling nearly everything you can think of. many many stalls of souvenirs, much like China town (3 for $10) and also many stalls for clothing.
if you don't like massive crowds or shopping its probably not somewhere you should go.

Bugis is Harajuku - Singapore version, in here u must slight to choose what ever u buy...
sometimes is more expensive than usually, so u must bargain as u can , example for the dress them hang in the price is SGD 10 , u can less it like SGD 8 .. the cheapest store in ground , the ground...


Bugis Street is one massive indoor flea market, spanning 3 floors across two buildings. Most of it is indoor and air conditioned, but some stalls have spilled out and over into the adjacent buildings and roads. There are some souvenir stalls along the first floor, but majority of the stalls here cater to young girls' fashion. Most novelty items can...


many merchandise you can choose here e.g watch, umbrella, clothes, keychain, etc. They also sell snacks if you hungry or fast food restaurant when you walk out here and it only take 3 or 4 minutes to get there.

Visited during the day in July about 36 degrees which means it was very hot inside! this market sells all matter of things but lots of stalls selling the same items! some good fashion for the youngies as long as you are a small size. Lots of junky souvenir items, such as key holders etc. nothing of quality available from...


Our hotel concierge advised us to go to Bugis street.it was very nice advice as my wife shopped a lot and I paid reasonably.in our next visit to Singapore ,we will spend more time in Bugis street.

We heard from someone about Bugis Junction, So we went there. While walking, we saw this street. We started walking inside it and surprisingly it was really very big. We shopped a lot. We spent around 6 hours here. My wife went to every shop and she always found something new to buy. Really great market.

If you are in the neighbourhood it is well worth visiting for the hustle and bustle of a street market. Be wary of pickpockets.

You could find almost everything from this place, and a great shopping area to find cheap souvenirs. you could find 4 for $10 t-shirts, keychain and any other stuffs which mostly sold 3 for $10. Prepare yourself to get sweaty though..

Bags, sun glasses, souvenirs and many stuffs with affordable price. 24 prices of Singapore iconic keychain only for 10SGD, 4 handbags also 10SGD. Try to going around this street before decide which shop that have a good deal for you (good quality with affordable price).

Imagine your local major flea market, then double its size and treble the number of customers. Yes, there is bucketloads of stuff to buy (occidentals will struggle to be the right size for clothing), but remember it is a flea market; quality will be difficult to find.

This is a nice place to get cheap stuff but it's too hot and stuffy. The crowd gets worst during weekends. So expect thousand of people and a big squeeze. Come prepared to sweat and getting the heat!
Would be really nice of its cooler.

Loved these markets. Visited them twice as it was hard to get it all in on one go. They do get very crowded though so can be difficult for families with small children and prams. Everything from fashion, souvenirs and food. A must see.

my favorite block in singapore hands down. Visited here first in 2011, then came back last month to find out it's now bigger than before. For people who has anxiety among crowds, I don't recommend this. but for those who have no problem moving back and forth in tiny space crowded with people, then this is it. Found the cheap...


One of the most important stuff to bring back home whenever you are on a holiday is souvenir; be it fridge magnet, key-chain, t-shirt etc. and I bet this place is among the favorite spot by many tourists who visited Singapore. Every souvenirs you can find in one (crowded) place. Easy access via the MRT and a proper Hylam Mall...


We had not really heard of Bugis St before going to Singapore - unlike the more famous Orchard Road. However, we did our best shopping here. Great malls and clothing shops - as well as nice places to eat. Worth the short MRT ride from City Hall. We found the shopping better than Orchard Road which tends to have a...


As far as shopping goes, it's hard to beat. You have an area with a China-town like vibe (and pricing), a hawker area, while on the other end there are the posh malls. A few blocks away are the art and music shops. It can get crowded, though.

We visited in the evening and it was initially a shock the sheer number of people - but this paled into insignificance compared to just how much stuff is crammed in there.
It is not an architecturally inspired building nor, I imagine, it is up there with the cultural highs of Singapore but nonetheless it was interesting/enjoyable and we picked...


A lively colourful market area full of smells especially "Durian" fruit not everyone's dream but it is part of any market in Singapore. So many places selling clothes, all kinds of street food & juices, a riot of noise colour not a place a for a gentle stroll, more a place to absorb the atmosphere. In January like all places...


One may read about the history of Bugis Street in the Wikipedia article of the same name, and in a number of Weblogs recalling history (and personal histories) associated with the original Bugis Street. The original Bugis Street was a unique "walking street" for eating, drinking, and people-watching. Arguably one of "the things to do in Singapore" in the 1960s...


This is where we bought souvenirs to bring home. T shirts, key chains, ash trays with singapore designs, magnets.

I liked this street as it is close to Bugis Junction mall, and Bugis Traditional Market which sale many souvenirs of Singapore icon. So, for people whose like shopping, this place really recommended for you and also there are so many hotel here. I disliked for the crowded situation and abit traffic.

Pretty much has everything you are looking for. Can be a tight squeeze through as it can be very packed by both people looking and stall holders themselves. Never really saw a 'quiet time' Was staying at a hotel opposite and went through a few different times of day and was generally packed.
Worth going too for those tat souvenirs...


I found the place very average. Average stalls, average prices, averagely kept, stall holders average. A bit disappointment really. Enough said.

A lot of very cheap clothes and souvenirs
Very manic on the weekends but still an experience. Get some cash before you got through the markets as everything is cash.
Good street style food and juice bars.
It's an experience worth doing and it's full of clothes for the kids and women not so much for guys.
Try to go...


This place is packed however a must visit for anyone visiting singapore. Its an experience. Very busy all the time. Some great souvenirs available at great prices.

Check out the map and you will see there are plenty of places to visit after you have passed bugis street. For instance, there's the famous local temple, called the Guan Yin Temple. The new shopping mall Bugis + ( can catch a movie there, or drink a cup of koi bubble tea ). Then walk a little further to...


If you look for souvenirs of singapore with a good price, come to Bugis street. Although the quality is not great but can't say bad. It is OK if you need to buy lots of souvenirs.
When the first time I visited Bugis street back to 10-15 years ago, I even could bargain to 40% discount. However the last visit...


The place is small, then it's so crowded and if you are budget shopper, it's a good choice to shop there, and you can buy souvenir there ( there's a lot of promotion ). But, if you don't like to shop or sightseeing in crowded place, better find other place to shop

We chose to stay near Bugis Village since we live to shop for cheap but nice stuff. There are plenty of shops which sells nice and funky clothes as well as shoes and sandals. Since my kids are teen agers and shopping at Orchard Road is quite expensive, this place is a good alternative. When taking the MRT, alight at...


Bugis street is right outside Bugis Station. So train is the best mode of travel. Around 800 shops under one roof and a huge range of variety is available for shoppers.
Best time to visit is around 11am since it is not that crowded. Have a look at everything first and then decide to buy. Same product will have different...


Great undercover airconditioned market place selling lots of cheap goods and many souvenirs. Great atmosphere although a bit crowded. Worth a visit for sure!

Last time I was in Bugis srt, was in 59 and 62. what a change, it was full of ladies, trouble was you couldn't tell the difference, between a real one or a ladyboy, unless you did a mick dundee

Bugis street, i can spend my whole afternoon here looking for souvenirs and cute accessories. However, i find the souvenir (fridge or key chain) cheaper in Chinatown. You may also walk to the Guan Yin temple and do some prayer.

This was my first visit here and went there on tripadvisor recommendations but they didn't pay it justice. This is by far my favourite part of Singapore for shopping - beats the massive shopping centres!
The street has heaps of charm with really cool artisan, vintage boutiques. Some are a little pricey but most aren't and you won't find the...


Whether its cheaps watches, clothing or food you want, head to the Bugis Street Markets and wander through the back streets. Its amazing!

Bugis was right near our hotel, spent nearly every night there since it is open until 10-11pm.
Wonderful shopping for teens and 20 somethings, especially girls. If you can bargain this is the place for you, as well as an excellent place to pick up souvenirs.
Regarding the "no trying allowed"- ask nicely as they will often let westerners try...


Bugis Street is just what markets should be. Lots of variety and the option to barter if you want. It is even better now than it was a few years ago as they have improved the air circulation which makes it a little more comfortable. You can find just about most things you would want and the only place to...


This is the market which many many people are not aware about..We found this place when we are looking on net for shopping and thought of giving it a try..The market is quite shabby like Ladies market of Hongkong or Patpong of Bangkok,But then shopping for cheap is here...U can scroll about as its a huge market and bargaining at...


If you need to buy clothes for your teens or people back home bugis is the place to go. They do sell souvenirs in bulk like a price for 24 key chains but it works out almost the same as Chinatown.

Extensive markets in and around Bugis Street. Different to other Asian markets elsewhere in that quality was a little better, was air conditioned (to some degree anyway) and no bartering/bargaining. All clothes seemed to be aimed at <30 year olds though...very little for us 50 somethings. One unique and questionable aspect was that you were expected to purchase without trying...


Shopping street it is....... but its mainly for ladies........ So visit only if you plan to shop for women...... again you will get small souveniers and also choclates in here.........

We stayed at the intercontinental so had easy access to Bugis Street. The stalls and shops are open late with a great range of souvenirs. There are plenty of cheap T-shirts, shoes, clothes etc but if you are not interested in the cheap items then just go for the atmosphere. There are also department stores in the immediate vicinity so...


Nice night ambience , just like night market. I wanted to buy I <3 SG t-shirt but it was expensive , S$15 fixed price ! I didnt buy it , I just bought another cloth. And I found that Giordano sells the original I <3 SG t shirt for S$15 too. I was so glad i didnt buy at bugis...


A must for anyone looking for some cheap holiday souvenirs to take back home.
There are lots of little shops set out in little streets under cover so no matter what the weather is you can shop away.
We did not stop for food but there is lots available and if it tastes half as good as it looks and...


There are 3 major shopping centres here, BHG, OG n ILLUMA where they sell more good quality products. There have everything from fashion wear , daily necessaries to IT products, anything you can think of, they have it here. At Bugis Village, you can get souvenirs at $2, T-Shirt at 3 for $10, Tote Bag at 4 for $10, Summer...


really good market went there twice. I prefer market shopping than department store and this market had quality clothing and shoes. Cheap watches and jewellry and was able to buy here for everyone back home

We visited this market this morning and whilst is busy and at times congested it is really good for purchasing souvenirs, presents for friends, with a large range of different stores all selling earrings, bags, Jewellery, cheap perfumes, electronic gadgets and accessories, cold juices etc... Really enjoyed buying some souvenirs to take home but you need time out afterwards! Te...


I obviously knew how expensive Singapore would be but was still shocked by the prices. So it was a welcomed surprised stumbling upon the Bugis street market with a variety of clothes, shoes, souvenirs, and other stuff that were more reasonably priced

We spent a couple of hours in these markets and didn't get to see it all. Prices are great. Good quality souvenir t-shirts for $10, or keyrings for $2 (the same they sell elsewhere for $6). If you want to supply your friends and family with souvenirs here is where you can achieve that on a budget. Oh - and...


Refreshing fruit juices available at only $1. Many shops selling clothes (as low as $5), accessories, shoes, souvenirs etc etc. Drop by if you'd like to get cheap souvenirs and clothings.

There are a lot of shopping malls in Singapore but Bugis is where you can find cheap but good finds. It is also near some hawker centers where you can eat authentic Singaporean food at an affordable price (way better than those at malls). Be ready though to walk and face the crazy crowd.

Its a place where you can get cheap and best. Get good souvenir . Bit crowded though.. Its jus outside green line and its very close to purple line as well. Shopping area. Have lots of manicurist and retail shop around.

I wouldnt say this market wasn't anything too exciting if you've done classic markets in other Asian cities yet isn't bad to check out.
We went around 8.45pm to pick up some hawkers food for a late dinner at the same time but a few of the stalls had shut up by then and a large portion of the food...


Take the MRT to Bugis station and check out Bugis Village as I doubt that you would be too disappointed. Busy with many shopping, browsing, eating and drinking options. My fave was grabbing fresh fruit juices at good prices ($1 SGD) or sit down and have a mango smoothie at one of the cafes along the pedestrian strip which afford...


Fortunately we stopped here early afternoon and had a quick walk around the market. The guide books seem to rave about it but it is really tacky with nothing worth buying. Many more interesting places in Singapore.
The one saving grace was that we found a good food court just outside Bugis Street MRT

Had an amazing time shopping in this area. Please explore the whole market before buying anything as they have some amazing variety and some good deals . Do explore the kstree which is just above .

Very huge place for shopping cheap clothes, watches, sovereigner etc
The entire place cannot be covered in a day. BAWARE that the place is really crowded

I have visited the market several times for the buzz. Its always bright and colourful. However, there is nothing in my size - even Asian XL is at best a European L and often only M.

Crazy busy, especially at weekends but good fun. You can buy cheap souvenirs and clothing for next to nothing.

We were advised to visit China Town and Little India, however, after visiting both we weren't that impressed. We then stumbled upon Bugis markets suggested by a local, 3 stories spread over a few streets, great food, great sales and great attraction. The Markets are open all day long and close around 10pm at night, the food stalls carry on...


Spent a fair bit of time at Bugis Street. Certainly if I had an unlimited budget and no clothes I might have found it more interesting but apart from that it was just a nice place to walk through.

Decided to go here after hearing a lot from my friends. Well - for guys - better avoid, its a ladies shopping area and mostly sovereigns. if you are looking for cheap watches and fresh fruit drinks this is the place. Be prepared to face the rush as it gets crowded very soon especially on weekends. With my experience -...


Located in front of Bugis Junction Mall, Bugis street is easily accessible.
you can buy souvenirs and chlotes, bags etc. with a very cheap price.

We love Bugis,stay in Sing for 5 days , came here 7 times, I have my first tatoo here, we have been offer really Big promotion when shopping in Bugis+. We are broke now .

It was a bit interesting, but it's very crowded and they mainly sell cheap junk and fakes. made in China", silly statement t-shirts sayng things like "University of Michigan Goldfish", also the ware is quite repetitive. Most of the stuff is "one size fits all", and they don't let you try it, but those sizes are for asians, and looked...


Bugis has always been a place for everyone. The unique fountain entertain the kids, shop as much as you can with better deals or simply hang out to kill your time. We have always had fun enjoying the water fountain, getting wet and watching kids place around.

The place to go for local sites and shopping of all sorts. I go there for the fresh market and rocks and minerals stores

This place is not hard to find ;). If you are a budget-conscious tourist, this is the place for you! This is like 168 shopping plaza in the Philippines where you can find and buy various
things like cheap bags; t-shirts, caps, sun
glasses. Though you could find there some
branded stores also that suits your taste! ;)

This is one of the liveliest and busy shopping area, which I came across. A complete paradise for people who love to shop and bargain. You can find anything and everything here with repeated shops and different variety. A lot of discounts were going on, when I visited and picked up quite a few things for gifting apart from shopping...


A shopping heaven, Bugis Village has everything from clothing, jeans, accessories, even adult shop. Variety of food and drinks also available and

This is the liviest shopping street in Singapore , you can find everything from clothing ,wathes , cosmetics, foods and drinks , frankly speaking almost anything with bargainable price.Its a 4 storey street mall and you all shops from bottom to top have a distictive merchandise.Near to the Bugis Junction , Bugis + shopping mall.Accessible from any part of Singapore...


Interesting places to shop that sells a variety of goods ranging from souvenirs to clothes. Feel free to bargain to get the best price, if you are tired of shopping, there are also a lot of drink and snack vending. Maybe this is a paradise for shopping lovers. Located opposite and close enough to the MRT station, to be able...


If you like market shopping you will be disappointed, if you don't like market shopping don't even bother. Remember they don't open until 10-11 and its the same thing over and over again. Lots of watches, t shirts, hair accessories, and phone cases. There are a lot of food stalls which is probably the only good thing about it.

Nothing special here. If you're from Jakarta, I could describe it more like "mangga dua". here's a place to shop. Either it's cloth, choco, or just eating food around. Nothing special to show..
Not really recommended for babies, cos it's very crowded... Hot, and none AC..

This is obviously is the most famous recommended shopping area for tourists who are seeking for things to bring back home as a keepsake for their loved-ones. This is the place where you can get tons of Singapore keychains at a very low price (frugal as you may be). TIP: shop around first and go for the lowest deal you...


It is a amazing place to Shop as it is also called the biggest street market of Singapore. This is indeed a shopping paradise for girls as this street offers lots of good merchandise like clothes, dresses, accessories & other gift items with reasonable rates.
It is well connected to MRT, drop down at BUGIS station & 5 minutes walk...


3 floors of shop like markets. Better quality clothing than what is in the markets and lots of cheap dresses for small people like me. Will take you a good couple of hours to work your way around it. Everything is cram packed in, but make sure you barter cos you can oftern get good discounts for multi buys. Just...


It is as beautiful as chaotic, I love Bugis Street, I like his hustle his flea market where it can be found anything and for those like me who love tropical fruit really low prices.
It is not only fruit, but there is really everything, including the dozens of stalls along the way.
This is one of those typical Asian...


This is an area of mix shopping. Value for money for young and trendy, tourist as well as locals. There are many shops around here which you can pick your choices. Food is ample here and it is conveniently next to the Bugis MRT station. Spent at least 3 hours here.

Mostly cheap and low quality clothing. Suitable place to shop for party gear. A lot of touristy stuff on ground floor and low quality snacks and food aligning the pathway.
Really cramp premises and the ventilation is terrible. Almost impossible to navigate during weekends.
Should go to the adjacent mall or Bugis Junction for decent air-conditioning on a hot day...


It is average for shopping.
I expected more but this complex has about 3 storey.
Nothing much if compared to shopping experience in Seoul or Malaysia.
The prices were a bit expensive. Of course if you walk the whole building you will be able to find some cheap stuff as well.
The location is very good near to the subway....


Bustling undercover Market selling lots of touristy tat, worth a visit but don't expect any fakes or it to be like markets in Hong Kong or Thailand.. Spent an hour here just walking through then trying to find my way back to my starting point... it was packed

Bugis Village is a place where you can do shopping for cheap prices compared to other places in Singapore. With a vast and dynamic product mix, Bugis Street is well known for its wide selection, competitive prices and quality merchandise that cater to anyone and everyone.
Bugis Street currently houses about 800 shops, which makes Bugis Street the Largest Street...


Since our hotel was located in between Little India and Bugis junction, we got to see both Little India and Bugis Village. I would describe this is more a residential area, where you can buy cheaper clothing, there are many shops and restaurants, also a huge food court that seems to be very inexpensive comparing to few other we visited,...


Went to Bugis village this june school holidays to purchase Vans shoes. As usual, it is quite a good plce to shop and lot of choices to eat.

If you dont want to shop then definitely dont go. Lots of small shops with lots of bargins.
You can also buy food items and other things you may need if you are staying a while.

Fun, full on, busy, frenetic, cheap no major shops just lots of small shops. Better atmosphere that the big sterile malls.
Spent a lot of time wandering around.

what do you do if you're a shopaholic, but on a limited budget in expensive singapore? You go to bugis, of course! Bugis is for shopaholic bargain hunters like me who get their thrills from cheapo finds and who'd sacrifice anything in the shopping--crowds, sweat, you name it! My measly shopping budget would have never survived without bugis. Orchard road...


A nice bargain shopping area worth a look. Theres also a nice chinese cuisine food court across the road.

This was a first time, i visit Bugis Street. SO excited with all the cheap goods. clothes basically are cheap. about 10-30 dollar. depend on the design and material. basically, if you can tolerate cheap goods with average quality of material, you should visit this place. it's not for people who love designer and fancy expensive things. the quality is...


Lots and lots of tiny shops but mostly selling crap and high priced crap save your time don't bother going there.
Hot and smelly

Greta place to buy anything, it's all cheap so don't expect top quality, but it provides value for money. Also has great iced drinks for a $1,as well as food and fruit. This place has been on my Singapore to do list since I first went there in 1976 (changed a bit though!)

Got its name from the Bugis people from Sulawesi, Indonesia. It serve as a trading point of the Bugis, and thats how the name came about. This is flea market or a shopping mecca for all those cheap goods or item like fake watches and women handbags. A good place to get your souvenir for giveway.

A back-alley roadside vendor typed scene where the Bugis from South Sulawesi province, Indonesia would do their trading, in the olden days. This used to be a tourist destination those days during my younger days. Today, popular spot still, against all the bigger and sophisticated malls. As time goes the STB has done a lot to upkeep the place and...


Bugis Street Markets are very hot and crowded. Many stalls all selling the same thing - cheap quality womens clothing and mobile phone accessories. A good place to go for the experience, but if it is shopping you want - there is much better around.

Bugis Street is indeed Singapore's epicentre of (cheap) shopping, and is surely a must-visit.
Depending on where you are, you can take a cab, a bus (double-check the number), or an MRT. From the MRT, you will simply pass through the mall, and cross the street to Bugis/ There you will find many stalls offering various products to choose from:...


There were tons of stalls upon stalls here. It was also ridiculously crowded. It wasn't the cheapest place to go to for souvenirs but it sure was an experience to walk around in.

The ground level of the complex sell souvenirs and delicacies. Prices are a bit cheaper and there are a lot to choose from. The upper floor and the rest is technically a girl's place. Clothes, shoes, bags, u name it! However its not the cheapest market in Asia. Markets in China and Bangkok can let you save more money.

We frequent this place very often and have still not been able to try all of the food and shopping etc. there's so many different things to do here that I'm sure there is something for everyone

Got many stalls you can visit, especially souvenirs, phone casings, or bags! There also got many malls you may shop,go there early morning for the bugis street.

Take your time to go through all the shops in the bugis village and I am sure one can find what they are looking for, at a very cheap price. You can get watches and goggles for as low as $5 and t-shirts starting from $3. IT also has shops that sells items which are over $100 as well. So,...


It is located next to Bugis MRT station, hence the ease of accessibility to the area. The newly renovated bugis village offers great buys at affordable pricing, the improved ventilation makes shopping in the crowded area more comfortable.

Enjoy Bugis Street but do take the time to explore the upper floors of the complex. Down on street level, many of the shops offer the same touristy stuff. Well, that is why we are in Bugis. But, up the levels and the shopping becomes more real. You will spend more money on ground level on touristy things. Upstairs isn't...


This place is located at the center of Singapore. One can enjoy the Street Shopping and can taste the different different cuisines of Singapore. This place a mixture of Shopping and Food Chains. One of happening place of Singapore.

The quality are better than mong Kok in hong kong. Ppl seems nicer and more comfortable than in mong kok hong kong .Price reasonable for these quality. If you want fitting room and service then go in shopping arcade . This is not what you will like. I am small build so size general ok.

i avoided the much hyped Mustafa for obvious reasons that Im not good at bargaianing. Most shops in bugis street have fixed rates and you dont feel cheated. Good ladies tops,purse available in the range of $12-20. Lots of studd in $2 to 5 range to be acrried as souveniers for folks in India

What a heaven market. Everything is cheap for souvenir.
Crowded like other market.
Stop and buy some uncle ice cream! Just 1$ to accompanying your shopping!

Was disappointed with Bugis St. The noise was a cacophony, the market stalls were all virtually 'one size fits my 5ft tweenage daughter' and nowhere to try any clothes on if you did happen to find something you might like to purchase.

Bugis street are just outside Bugis MRT. This is at its peak in the nights. Small street shops full of variety specially young girls cloths, accessories and suitable place for buying cheap Singapore souvenirs. My kids bought wrist watches and key rings. Garments have a lot of variety but a bit small for average Indian standards & also a bit...


Very busy market area, loads of the same and would appear all prices fixed, no real bartering (better in China town KL). Couldn't find the dodgy handbags/shoes/watches. Eating at the hawkers dinners is an experience worth having.

Economic shopping point in singapore, nice place to hang out with friends, god food places around, with a blessed McD at the MRT of bugis, subway is the good option at bugis mall, walled with hotel intercontinental

One of the many indoor and street shopping/retail in Singapore. Crowded with people and shopper bargaining a highlight, if you are up to it. Anything and everything you might be interested in buying. If you a shopper and bargain hunter, this might be your cup of tea. You can purchase t-shirts to tailored suits and souvenirs.

A must do in Singapore is to visit the Bugis street markets. Here you will find pretty much any knick knack item that you will need. There are a lot of the same stalls selling the same thing so it does get a little repetitious. If you need to buy a lot of souvernirs for family and friends when you...

Bugis street, i can spend my whole afternoon here looking for souvenirs and cute accessories. However, i find the souvenir (fridge or key chain) cheaper in Chinatown. You may also walk to the Guan Yin temple and do some prayer.

Our hotel concierge advised us to go to Bugis street.it was very nice advice as my wife shopped a lot and I paid reasonably.in our next visit to Singapore ,we will spend more time in Bugis street.

We heard from someone about Bugis Junction, So we went there. While walking, we saw this street. We started walking inside it and surprisingly it was really very big. We shopped a lot. We spent around 6 hours here. My wife went to every shop and she always found something new to buy. Really great market.

If you are in the neighbourhood it is well worth visiting for the hustle and bustle of a street market. Be wary of pickpockets.

You could find almost everything from this place, and a great shopping area to find cheap souvenirs. you could find 4 for $10 t-shirts, keychain and any other stuffs which mostly sold 3 for $10. Prepare yourself to get sweaty though..

Bags, sun glasses, souvenirs and many stuffs with affordable price. 24 prices of Singapore iconic keychain only for 10SGD, 4 handbags also 10SGD. Try to going around this street before decide which shop that have a good deal for you (good quality with affordable price).

Imagine your local major flea market, then double its size and treble the number of customers. Yes, there is bucketloads of stuff to buy (occidentals will struggle to be the right size for clothing), but remember it is a flea market; quality will be difficult to find.

This is a nice place to get cheap stuff but it's too hot and stuffy. The crowd gets worst during weekends. So expect thousand of people and a big squeeze. Come prepared to sweat and getting the heat!
Would be really nice of its cooler.

Loved these markets. Visited them twice as it was hard to get it all in on one go. They do get very crowded though so can be difficult for families with small children and prams. Everything from fashion, souvenirs and food. A must see.

my favorite block in singapore hands down. Visited here first in 2011, then came back last month to find out it's now bigger than before. For people who has anxiety among crowds, I don't recommend this. but for those who have no problem moving back and forth in tiny space crowded with people, then this is it. Found the cheap...


One of the most important stuff to bring back home whenever you are on a holiday is souvenir; be it fridge magnet, key-chain, t-shirt etc. and I bet this place is among the favorite spot by many tourists who visited Singapore. Every souvenirs you can find in one (crowded) place. Easy access via the MRT and a proper Hylam Mall...


Bugis Street is a unique retail shopping destination. After undergoing a major facelift, Bugis Street now houses almost 800 shops, making it the largest street shopping location in Singapore. With a vast and dynamic product mix, Bugis Street is well known for its wide selection, competitive prices and quality merchandise that cater to anyone and everyone. The entire street came...


Really lovely place to shop! Compared to malls, this is fairly cheaper. I bought all my stuff here, with the exception of some stuff from Typo store.
Highly recommended to budget travelers! But before you buy anything, make sure to check each stall first! That's what I did, and good thing I did that because I saw cheaper version of...


If you are looking for women's fashion it's great, if you are slim. You are not able to try anything on which makes it difficult. The prices are cheap so it's not a big loss if you buy something you can't wear. My husband was disappointed because there were not many places to buy mens clothing and it was all...


It is a shoppers paradise. Absolutely loved it!!! All local stuff at really cheap prices. But the quality is great.
Its a huge huge market so look out for every turn you take. I was lost.

This marketplace was air conditioned which surprised me as most markets do not have air conditioning. This market caters for young girls fashion (mostly all one size fits all) and some men's clothing but bare in mind, they have a policy where you cannot try it on. There are heaps of cheap souvenirs and the fresh juice is really cheap...


Bugis street is now one massive indoor market place selling nearly everything you can think of. many many stalls of souvenirs, much like China town (3 for $10) and also many stalls for clothing.
if you don't like massive crowds or shopping its probably not somewhere you should go.

Bugis is Harajuku - Singapore version, in here u must slight to choose what ever u buy...
sometimes is more expensive than usually, so u must bargain as u can , example for the dress them hang in the price is SGD 10 , u can less it like SGD 8 .. the cheapest store in ground , the ground...


Bugis Street is one massive indoor flea market, spanning 3 floors across two buildings. Most of it is indoor and air conditioned, but some stalls have spilled out and over into the adjacent buildings and roads. There are some souvenir stalls along the first floor, but majority of the stalls here cater to young girls' fashion. Most novelty items can...


many merchandise you can choose here e.g watch, umbrella, clothes, keychain, etc. They also sell snacks if you hungry or fast food restaurant when you walk out here and it only take 3 or 4 minutes to get there.

Visited during the day in July about 36 degrees which means it was very hot inside! this market sells all matter of things but lots of stalls selling the same items! some good fashion for the youngies as long as you are a small size. Lots of junky souvenir items, such as key holders etc. nothing of quality available from...


We had not really heard of Bugis St before going to Singapore - unlike the more famous Orchard Road. However, we did our best shopping here. Great malls and clothing shops - as well as nice places to eat. Worth the short MRT ride from City Hall. We found the shopping better than Orchard Road which tends to have a...


As far as shopping goes, it's hard to beat. You have an area with a China-town like vibe (and pricing), a hawker area, while on the other end there are the posh malls. A few blocks away are the art and music shops. It can get crowded, though.

We visited in the evening and it was initially a shock the sheer number of people - but this paled into insignificance compared to just how much stuff is crammed in there.
It is not an architecturally inspired building nor, I imagine, it is up there with the cultural highs of Singapore but nonetheless it was interesting/enjoyable and we picked...


A lively colourful market area full of smells especially "Durian" fruit not everyone's dream but it is part of any market in Singapore. So many places selling clothes, all kinds of street food & juices, a riot of noise colour not a place a for a gentle stroll, more a place to absorb the atmosphere. In January like all places...


One may read about the history of Bugis Street in the Wikipedia article of the same name, and in a number of Weblogs recalling history (and personal histories) associated with the original Bugis Street. The original Bugis Street was a unique "walking street" for eating, drinking, and people-watching. Arguably one of "the things to do in Singapore" in the 1960s...


This is where we bought souvenirs to bring home. T shirts, key chains, ash trays with singapore designs, magnets.

I liked this street as it is close to Bugis Junction mall, and Bugis Traditional Market which sale many souvenirs of Singapore icon. So, for people whose like shopping, this place really recommended for you and also there are so many hotel here. I disliked for the crowded situation and abit traffic.

Pretty much has everything you are looking for. Can be a tight squeeze through as it can be very packed by both people looking and stall holders themselves. Never really saw a 'quiet time' Was staying at a hotel opposite and went through a few different times of day and was generally packed.
Worth going too for those tat souvenirs...


I found the place very average. Average stalls, average prices, averagely kept, stall holders average. A bit disappointment really. Enough said.

Take the MRT to Bugis station and check out Bugis Village as I doubt that you would be too disappointed. Busy with many shopping, browsing, eating and drinking options. My fave was grabbing fresh fruit juices at good prices ($1 SGD) or sit down and have a mango smoothie at one of the cafes along the pedestrian strip which afford...


Fortunately we stopped here early afternoon and had a quick walk around the market. The guide books seem to rave about it but it is really tacky with nothing worth buying. Many more interesting places in Singapore.
The one saving grace was that we found a good food court just outside Bugis Street MRT

Had an amazing time shopping in this area. Please explore the whole market before buying anything as they have some amazing variety and some good deals . Do explore the kstree which is just above .

Very huge place for shopping cheap clothes, watches, sovereigner etc
The entire place cannot be covered in a day. BAWARE that the place is really crowded

I have visited the market several times for the buzz. Its always bright and colourful. However, there is nothing in my size - even Asian XL is at best a European L and often only M.

Crazy busy, especially at weekends but good fun. You can buy cheap souvenirs and clothing for next to nothing.

We were advised to visit China Town and Little India, however, after visiting both we weren't that impressed. We then stumbled upon Bugis markets suggested by a local, 3 stories spread over a few streets, great food, great sales and great attraction. The Markets are open all day long and close around 10pm at night, the food stalls carry on...


Spent a fair bit of time at Bugis Street. Certainly if I had an unlimited budget and no clothes I might have found it more interesting but apart from that it was just a nice place to walk through.

Decided to go here after hearing a lot from my friends. Well - for guys - better avoid, its a ladies shopping area and mostly sovereigns. if you are looking for cheap watches and fresh fruit drinks this is the place. Be prepared to face the rush as it gets crowded very soon especially on weekends. With my experience -...


Located in front of Bugis Junction Mall, Bugis street is easily accessible.
you can buy souvenirs and chlotes, bags etc. with a very cheap price.

We love Bugis,stay in Sing for 5 days , came here 7 times, I have my first tatoo here, we have been offer really Big promotion when shopping in Bugis+. We are broke now .

It was a bit interesting, but it's very crowded and they mainly sell cheap junk and fakes. made in China", silly statement t-shirts sayng things like "University of Michigan Goldfish", also the ware is quite repetitive. Most of the stuff is "one size fits all", and they don't let you try it, but those sizes are for asians, and looked...


Bugis has always been a place for everyone. The unique fountain entertain the kids, shop as much as you can with better deals or simply hang out to kill your time. We have always had fun enjoying the water fountain, getting wet and watching kids place around.

The place to go for local sites and shopping of all sorts. I go there for the fresh market and rocks and minerals stores

This place is not hard to find ;). If you are a budget-conscious tourist, this is the place for you! This is like 168 shopping plaza in the Philippines where you can find and buy various
things like cheap bags; t-shirts, caps, sun
glasses. Though you could find there some
branded stores also that suits your taste! ;)

This is one of the liveliest and busy shopping area, which I came across. A complete paradise for people who love to shop and bargain. You can find anything and everything here with repeated shops and different variety. A lot of discounts were going on, when I visited and picked up quite a few things for gifting apart from shopping...


A shopping heaven, Bugis Village has everything from clothing, jeans, accessories, even adult shop. Variety of food and drinks also available and

This is the liviest shopping street in Singapore , you can find everything from clothing ,wathes , cosmetics, foods and drinks , frankly speaking almost anything with bargainable price.Its a 4 storey street mall and you all shops from bottom to top have a distictive merchandise.Near to the Bugis Junction , Bugis + shopping mall.Accessible from any part of Singapore...


Interesting places to shop that sells a variety of goods ranging from souvenirs to clothes. Feel free to bargain to get the best price, if you are tired of shopping, there are also a lot of drink and snack vending. Maybe this is a paradise for shopping lovers. Located opposite and close enough to the MRT station, to be able...


If you like market shopping you will be disappointed, if you don't like market shopping don't even bother. Remember they don't open until 10-11 and its the same thing over and over again. Lots of watches, t shirts, hair accessories, and phone cases. There are a lot of food stalls which is probably the only good thing about it.

This was my first visit here and went there on tripadvisor recommendations but they didn't pay it justice. This is by far my favourite part of Singapore for shopping - beats the massive shopping centres!
The street has heaps of charm with really cool artisan, vintage boutiques. Some are a little pricey but most aren't and you won't find the...


Whether its cheaps watches, clothing or food you want, head to the Bugis Street Markets and wander through the back streets. Its amazing!

Bugis was right near our hotel, spent nearly every night there since it is open until 10-11pm.
Wonderful shopping for teens and 20 somethings, especially girls. If you can bargain this is the place for you, as well as an excellent place to pick up souvenirs.
Regarding the "no trying allowed"- ask nicely as they will often let westerners try...


Bugis Street is just what markets should be. Lots of variety and the option to barter if you want. It is even better now than it was a few years ago as they have improved the air circulation which makes it a little more comfortable. You can find just about most things you would want and the only place to...


This is the market which many many people are not aware about..We found this place when we are looking on net for shopping and thought of giving it a try..The market is quite shabby like Ladies market of Hongkong or Patpong of Bangkok,But then shopping for cheap is here...U can scroll about as its a huge market and bargaining at...


If you need to buy clothes for your teens or people back home bugis is the place to go. They do sell souvenirs in bulk like a price for 24 key chains but it works out almost the same as Chinatown.

Extensive markets in and around Bugis Street. Different to other Asian markets elsewhere in that quality was a little better, was air conditioned (to some degree anyway) and no bartering/bargaining. All clothes seemed to be aimed at <30 year olds though...very little for us 50 somethings. One unique and questionable aspect was that you were expected to purchase without trying...


Shopping street it is....... but its mainly for ladies........ So visit only if you plan to shop for women...... again you will get small souveniers and also choclates in here.........

We stayed at the intercontinental so had easy access to Bugis Street. The stalls and shops are open late with a great range of souvenirs. There are plenty of cheap T-shirts, shoes, clothes etc but if you are not interested in the cheap items then just go for the atmosphere. There are also department stores in the immediate vicinity so...


Nice night ambience , just like night market. I wanted to buy I <3 SG t-shirt but it was expensive , S$15 fixed price ! I didnt buy it , I just bought another cloth. And I found that Giordano sells the original I <3 SG t shirt for S$15 too. I was so glad i didnt buy at bugis...


Nothing special here. If you're from Jakarta, I could describe it more like "mangga dua". here's a place to shop. Either it's cloth, choco, or just eating food around. Nothing special to show..
Not really recommended for babies, cos it's very crowded... Hot, and none AC..

This is obviously is the most famous recommended shopping area for tourists who are seeking for things to bring back home as a keepsake for their loved-ones. This is the place where you can get tons of Singapore keychains at a very low price (frugal as you may be). TIP: shop around first and go for the lowest deal you...


It is a amazing place to Shop as it is also called the biggest street market of Singapore. This is indeed a shopping paradise for girls as this street offers lots of good merchandise like clothes, dresses, accessories & other gift items with reasonable rates.
It is well connected to MRT, drop down at BUGIS station & 5 minutes walk...


3 floors of shop like markets. Better quality clothing than what is in the markets and lots of cheap dresses for small people like me. Will take you a good couple of hours to work your way around it. Everything is cram packed in, but make sure you barter cos you can oftern get good discounts for multi buys. Just...


It is as beautiful as chaotic, I love Bugis Street, I like his hustle his flea market where it can be found anything and for those like me who love tropical fruit really low prices.
It is not only fruit, but there is really everything, including the dozens of stalls along the way.
This is one of those typical Asian...


This is an area of mix shopping. Value for money for young and trendy, tourist as well as locals. There are many shops around here which you can pick your choices. Food is ample here and it is conveniently next to the Bugis MRT station. Spent at least 3 hours here.

Mostly cheap and low quality clothing. Suitable place to shop for party gear. A lot of touristy stuff on ground floor and low quality snacks and food aligning the pathway.
Really cramp premises and the ventilation is terrible. Almost impossible to navigate during weekends.
Should go to the adjacent mall or Bugis Junction for decent air-conditioning on a hot day...


It is average for shopping.
I expected more but this complex has about 3 storey.
Nothing much if compared to shopping experience in Seoul or Malaysia.
The prices were a bit expensive. Of course if you walk the whole building you will be able to find some cheap stuff as well.
The location is very good near to the subway....


Bustling undercover Market selling lots of touristy tat, worth a visit but don't expect any fakes or it to be like markets in Hong Kong or Thailand.. Spent an hour here just walking through then trying to find my way back to my starting point... it was packed

Bugis Village is a place where you can do shopping for cheap prices compared to other places in Singapore. With a vast and dynamic product mix, Bugis Street is well known for its wide selection, competitive prices and quality merchandise that cater to anyone and everyone.
Bugis Street currently houses about 800 shops, which makes Bugis Street the Largest Street...


A back-alley roadside vendor typed scene where the Bugis from South Sulawesi province, Indonesia would do their trading, in the olden days. This used to be a tourist destination those days during my younger days. Today, popular spot still, against all the bigger and sophisticated malls. As time goes the STB has done a lot to upkeep the place and...


Bugis Street Markets are very hot and crowded. Many stalls all selling the same thing - cheap quality womens clothing and mobile phone accessories. A good place to go for the experience, but if it is shopping you want - there is much better around.

Bugis Street is indeed Singapore's epicentre of (cheap) shopping, and is surely a must-visit.
Depending on where you are, you can take a cab, a bus (double-check the number), or an MRT. From the MRT, you will simply pass through the mall, and cross the street to Bugis/ There you will find many stalls offering various products to choose from:...


There were tons of stalls upon stalls here. It was also ridiculously crowded. It wasn't the cheapest place to go to for souvenirs but it sure was an experience to walk around in.

The ground level of the complex sell souvenirs and delicacies. Prices are a bit cheaper and there are a lot to choose from. The upper floor and the rest is technically a girl's place. Clothes, shoes, bags, u name it! However its not the cheapest market in Asia. Markets in China and Bangkok can let you save more money.

We frequent this place very often and have still not been able to try all of the food and shopping etc. there's so many different things to do here that I'm sure there is something for everyone

Got many stalls you can visit, especially souvenirs, phone casings, or bags! There also got many malls you may shop,go there early morning for the bugis street.

Take your time to go through all the shops in the bugis village and I am sure one can find what they are looking for, at a very cheap price. You can get watches and goggles for as low as $5 and t-shirts starting from $3. IT also has shops that sells items which are over $100 as well. So,...


It is located next to Bugis MRT station, hence the ease of accessibility to the area. The newly renovated bugis village offers great buys at affordable pricing, the improved ventilation makes shopping in the crowded area more comfortable.

Enjoy Bugis Street but do take the time to explore the upper floors of the complex. Down on street level, many of the shops offer the same touristy stuff. Well, that is why we are in Bugis. But, up the levels and the shopping becomes more real. You will spend more money on ground level on touristy things. Upstairs isn't...


Since our hotel was located in between Little India and Bugis junction, we got to see both Little India and Bugis Village. I would describe this is more a residential area, where you can buy cheaper clothing, there are many shops and restaurants, also a huge food court that seems to be very inexpensive comparing to few other we visited,...


Went to Bugis village this june school holidays to purchase Vans shoes. As usual, it is quite a good plce to shop and lot of choices to eat.

If you dont want to shop then definitely dont go. Lots of small shops with lots of bargins.
You can also buy food items and other things you may need if you are staying a while.

Fun, full on, busy, frenetic, cheap no major shops just lots of small shops. Better atmosphere that the big sterile malls.
Spent a lot of time wandering around.

what do you do if you're a shopaholic, but on a limited budget in expensive singapore? You go to bugis, of course! Bugis is for shopaholic bargain hunters like me who get their thrills from cheapo finds and who'd sacrifice anything in the shopping--crowds, sweat, you name it! My measly shopping budget would have never survived without bugis. Orchard road...


A nice bargain shopping area worth a look. Theres also a nice chinese cuisine food court across the road.

This was a first time, i visit Bugis Street. SO excited with all the cheap goods. clothes basically are cheap. about 10-30 dollar. depend on the design and material. basically, if you can tolerate cheap goods with average quality of material, you should visit this place. it's not for people who love designer and fancy expensive things. the quality is...


Lots and lots of tiny shops but mostly selling crap and high priced crap save your time don't bother going there.
Hot and smelly

Greta place to buy anything, it's all cheap so don't expect top quality, but it provides value for money. Also has great iced drinks for a $1,as well as food and fruit. This place has been on my Singapore to do list since I first went there in 1976 (changed a bit though!)

Got its name from the Bugis people from Sulawesi, Indonesia. It serve as a trading point of the Bugis, and thats how the name came about. This is flea market or a shopping mecca for all those cheap goods or item like fake watches and women handbags. A good place to get your souvenir for giveway.

A must for anyone looking for some cheap holiday souvenirs to take back home.
There are lots of little shops set out in little streets under cover so no matter what the weather is you can shop away.
We did not stop for food but there is lots available and if it tastes half as good as it looks and...


There are 3 major shopping centres here, BHG, OG n ILLUMA where they sell more good quality products. There have everything from fashion wear , daily necessaries to IT products, anything you can think of, they have it here. At Bugis Village, you can get souvenirs at $2, T-Shirt at 3 for $10, Tote Bag at 4 for $10, Summer...


really good market went there twice. I prefer market shopping than department store and this market had quality clothing and shoes. Cheap watches and jewellry and was able to buy here for everyone back home

We visited this market this morning and whilst is busy and at times congested it is really good for purchasing souvenirs, presents for friends, with a large range of different stores all selling earrings, bags, Jewellery, cheap perfumes, electronic gadgets and accessories, cold juices etc... Really enjoyed buying some souvenirs to take home but you need time out afterwards! Te...


I obviously knew how expensive Singapore would be but was still shocked by the prices. So it was a welcomed surprised stumbling upon the Bugis street market with a variety of clothes, shoes, souvenirs, and other stuff that were more reasonably priced

We spent a couple of hours in these markets and didn't get to see it all. Prices are great. Good quality souvenir t-shirts for $10, or keyrings for $2 (the same they sell elsewhere for $6). If you want to supply your friends and family with souvenirs here is where you can achieve that on a budget. Oh - and...


Refreshing fruit juices available at only $1. Many shops selling clothes (as low as $5), accessories, shoes, souvenirs etc etc. Drop by if you'd like to get cheap souvenirs and clothings.

There are a lot of shopping malls in Singapore but Bugis is where you can find cheap but good finds. It is also near some hawker centers where you can eat authentic Singaporean food at an affordable price (way better than those at malls). Be ready though to walk and face the crazy crowd.

Its a place where you can get cheap and best. Get good souvenir . Bit crowded though.. Its jus outside green line and its very close to purple line as well. Shopping area. Have lots of manicurist and retail shop around.

I wouldnt say this market wasn't anything too exciting if you've done classic markets in other Asian cities yet isn't bad to check out.
We went around 8.45pm to pick up some hawkers food for a late dinner at the same time but a few of the stalls had shut up by then and a large portion of the food...


This place is located at the center of Singapore. One can enjoy the Street Shopping and can taste the different different cuisines of Singapore. This place a mixture of Shopping and Food Chains. One of happening place of Singapore.

The quality are better than mong Kok in hong kong. Ppl seems nicer and more comfortable than in mong kok hong kong .Price reasonable for these quality. If you want fitting room and service then go in shopping arcade . This is not what you will like. I am small build so size general ok.

i avoided the much hyped Mustafa for obvious reasons that Im not good at bargaianing. Most shops in bugis street have fixed rates and you dont feel cheated. Good ladies tops,purse available in the range of $12-20. Lots of studd in $2 to 5 range to be acrried as souveniers for folks in India

What a heaven market. Everything is cheap for souvenir.
Crowded like other market.
Stop and buy some uncle ice cream! Just 1$ to accompanying your shopping!

Was disappointed with Bugis St. The noise was a cacophony, the market stalls were all virtually 'one size fits my 5ft tweenage daughter' and nowhere to try any clothes on if you did happen to find something you might like to purchase.

Bugis street are just outside Bugis MRT. This is at its peak in the nights. Small street shops full of variety specially young girls cloths, accessories and suitable place for buying cheap Singapore souvenirs. My kids bought wrist watches and key rings. Garments have a lot of variety but a bit small for average Indian standards & also a bit...


Very busy market area, loads of the same and would appear all prices fixed, no real bartering (better in China town KL). Couldn't find the dodgy handbags/shoes/watches. Eating at the hawkers dinners is an experience worth having.

Economic shopping point in singapore, nice place to hang out with friends, god food places around, with a blessed McD at the MRT of bugis, subway is the good option at bugis mall, walled with hotel intercontinental

One of the many indoor and street shopping/retail in Singapore. Crowded with people and shopper bargaining a highlight, if you are up to it. Anything and everything you might be interested in buying. If you a shopper and bargain hunter, this might be your cup of tea. You can purchase t-shirts to tailored suits and souvenirs.

A must do in Singapore is to visit the Bugis street markets. Here you will find pretty much any knick knack item that you will need. There are a lot of the same stalls selling the same thing so it does get a little repetitious. If you need to buy a lot of souvernirs for family and friends when you...

Our hotel concierge advised us to go to Bugis street.it was very nice advice as my wife shopped a lot and I paid reasonably.in our next visit to Singapore ,we will spend more time in Bugis street.

We heard from someone about Bugis Junction, So we went there. While walking, we saw this street. We started walking inside it and surprisingly it was really very big. We shopped a lot. We spent around 6 hours here. My wife went to every shop and she always found something new to buy. Really great market.

If you are in the neighbourhood it is well worth visiting for the hustle and bustle of a street market. Be wary of pickpockets.

You could find almost everything from this place, and a great shopping area to find cheap souvenirs. you could find 4 for $10 t-shirts, keychain and any other stuffs which mostly sold 3 for $10. Prepare yourself to get sweaty though..

Bags, sun glasses, souvenirs and many stuffs with affordable price. 24 prices of Singapore iconic keychain only for 10SGD, 4 handbags also 10SGD. Try to going around this street before decide which shop that have a good deal for you (good quality with affordable price).

Imagine your local major flea market, then double its size and treble the number of customers. Yes, there is bucketloads of stuff to buy (occidentals will struggle to be the right size for clothing), but remember it is a flea market; quality will be difficult to find.

This is a nice place to get cheap stuff but it's too hot and stuffy. The crowd gets worst during weekends. So expect thousand of people and a big squeeze. Come prepared to sweat and getting the heat!
Would be really nice of its cooler.

Loved these markets. Visited them twice as it was hard to get it all in on one go. They do get very crowded though so can be difficult for families with small children and prams. Everything from fashion, souvenirs and food. A must see.

my favorite block in singapore hands down. Visited here first in 2011, then came back last month to find out it's now bigger than before.

One of the most important stuff to bring back home whenever you are on a holiday is souvenir; be it fridge magnet, key-chain, t-shirt etc. and I bet this place is among the favorite spot by many tourists who visited Singapore. Every souvenirs you can find in one (crowded) place. Easy access via the MRT and a proper Hylam Mall...

A lively colourful market area full of smells especially "Durian" fruit not everyone's dream but it is part of any market in Singapore. So many places selling clothes, all kinds of street food & juices, a riot of noise colour not a place a for a gentle stroll, more a place to absorb the atmosphere. In January like all places...


One may read about the history of Bugis Street in the Wikipedia article of the same name, and in a number of Weblogs recalling history (and personal histories) associated with the original Bugis Street. The original Bugis Street was a unique "walking street" for eating, drinking, and people-watching. Arguably one of "the things to do in Singapore" in the 1960s...


This is where we bought souvenirs to bring home. T shirts, key chains, ash trays with singapore designs, magnets.

I liked this street as it is close to Bugis Junction mall, and Bugis Traditional Market which sale many souvenirs of Singapore icon. So, for people whose like shopping, this place really recommended for you and also there are so many hotel here. I disliked for the crowded situation and abit traffic.

Pretty much has everything you are looking for. Can be a tight squeeze through as it can be very packed by both people looking and stall holders themselves. Never really saw a 'quiet time' Was staying at a hotel opposite and went through a few different times of day and was generally packed.
Worth going too for those tat souvenirs...


I found the place very average. Average stalls, average prices, averagely kept, stall holders average. A bit disappointment really. Enough said.

A lot of very cheap clothes and souvenirs
Very manic on the weekends but still an experience. Get some cash before you got through the markets as everything is cash.
Good street style food and juice bars.
It's an experience worth doing and it's full of clothes for the kids and women not so much for guys.
Try to go...


This place is packed however a must visit for anyone visiting singapore. Its an experience. Very busy all the time. Some great souvenirs available at great prices.

Check out the map and you will see there are plenty of places to visit after you have passed bugis street. For instance, there's the famous local temple, called the Guan Yin Temple. The new shopping mall Bugis + ( can catch a movie there, or drink a cup of koi bubble tea ). Then walk a little further to...


If you look for souvenirs of singapore with a good price, come to Bugis street. Although the quality is not great but can't say bad. It is OK if you need to buy lots of souvenirs.
When the first time I visited Bugis street back to 10-15 years ago, I even could bargain to 40% discount. However the last visit...


The place is small, then it's so crowded and if you are budget shopper, it's a good choice to shop there, and you can buy souvenir there ( there's a lot of promotion ). But, if you don't like to shop or sightseeing in crowded place, better find other place to shop

We chose to stay near Bugis Village since we live to shop for cheap but nice stuff. There are plenty of shops which sells nice and funky clothes as well as shoes and sandals. Since my kids are teen agers and shopping at Orchard Road is quite expensive, this place is a good alternative. When taking the MRT, alight at...


Bugis street is right outside Bugis Station. So train is the best mode of travel. Around 800 shops under one roof and a huge range of variety is available for shoppers.
Best time to visit is around 11am since it is not that crowded. Have a look at everything first and then decide to buy. Same product will have different...


Great undercover airconditioned market place selling lots of cheap goods and many souvenirs. Great atmosphere although a bit crowded. Worth a visit for sure!

Last time I was in Bugis srt, was in 59 and 62. what a change, it was full of ladies, trouble was you couldn't tell the difference, between a real one or a ladyboy, unless you did a mick dundee

Bugis street, i can spend my whole afternoon here looking for souvenirs and cute accessories. However, i find the souvenir (fridge or key chain) cheaper in Chinatown. You may also walk to the Guan Yin temple and do some prayer.

We love Bugis,stay in Sing for 5 days , came here 7 times, I have my first tatoo here, we have been offer really Big promotion when shopping in Bugis+. We are broke now .

It was a bit interesting, but it's very crowded and they mainly sell cheap junk and fakes. made in China", silly statement t-shirts sayng things like "University of Michigan Goldfish", also the ware is quite repetitive. Most of the stuff is "one size fits all", and they don't let you try it, but those sizes are for asians, and looked...


Bugis has always been a place for everyone. The unique fountain entertain the kids, shop as much as you can with better deals or simply hang out to kill your time. We have always had fun enjoying the water fountain, getting wet and watching kids place around.

The place to go for local sites and shopping of all sorts. I go there for the fresh market and rocks and minerals stores

This place is not hard to find ;). If you are a budget-conscious tourist, this is the place for you! This is like 168 shopping plaza in the Philippines where you can find and buy various
things like cheap bags; t-shirts, caps, sun
glasses. Though you could find there some
branded stores also that suits your taste! ;)

This is one of the liveliest and busy shopping area, which I came across. A complete paradise for people who love to shop and bargain. You can find anything and everything here with repeated shops and different variety. A lot of discounts were going on, when I visited and picked up quite a few things for gifting apart from shopping...


A shopping heaven, Bugis Village has everything from clothing, jeans, accessories, even adult shop. Variety of food and drinks also available and

This is the liviest shopping street in Singapore , you can find everything from clothing ,wathes , cosmetics, foods and drinks , frankly speaking almost anything with bargainable price.Its a 4 storey street mall and you all shops from bottom to top have a distictive merchandise.Near to the Bugis Junction , Bugis + shopping mall.Accessible from any part of Singapore...


Interesting places to shop that sells a variety of goods ranging from souvenirs to clothes. Feel free to bargain to get the best price, if you are tired of shopping, there are also a lot of drink and snack vending. Maybe this is a paradise for shopping lovers. Located opposite and close enough to the MRT station, to be able...


If you like market shopping you will be disappointed, if you don't like market shopping don't even bother. Remember they don't open until 10-11 and its the same thing over and over again. Lots of watches, t shirts, hair accessories, and phone cases. There are a lot of food stalls which is probably the only good thing about it.

Take the MRT to Bugis station and check out Bugis Village as I doubt that you would be too disappointed. Busy with many shopping, browsing, eating and drinking options. My fave was grabbing fresh fruit juices at good prices ($1 SGD) or sit down and have a mango smoothie at one of the cafes along the pedestrian strip which afford...


Fortunately we stopped here early afternoon and had a quick walk around the market. The guide books seem to rave about it but it is really tacky with nothing worth buying. Many more interesting places in Singapore.
The one saving grace was that we found a good food court just outside Bugis Street MRT

Had an amazing time shopping in this area. Please explore the whole market before buying anything as they have some amazing variety and some good deals . Do explore the kstree which is just above .

Very huge place for shopping cheap clothes, watches, sovereigner etc
The entire place cannot be covered in a day. BAWARE that the place is really crowded

I have visited the market several times for the buzz. Its always bright and colourful. However, there is nothing in my size - even Asian XL is at best a European L and often only M.

Crazy busy, especially at weekends but good fun. You can buy cheap souvenirs and clothing for next to nothing.

We were advised to visit China Town and Little India, however, after visiting both we weren't that impressed. We then stumbled upon Bugis markets suggested by a local, 3 stories spread over a few streets, great food, great sales and great attraction. The Markets are open all day long and close around 10pm at night, the food stalls carry on...


Spent a fair bit of time at Bugis Street. Certainly if I had an unlimited budget and no clothes I might have found it more interesting but apart from that it was just a nice place to walk through.

Decided to go here after hearing a lot from my friends. Well - for guys - better avoid, its a ladies shopping area and mostly sovereigns. if you are looking for cheap watches and fresh fruit drinks this is the place. Be prepared to face the rush as it gets crowded very soon especially on weekends. With my experience -...


Located in front of Bugis Junction Mall, Bugis street is easily accessible.
you can buy souvenirs and chlotes, bags etc. with a very cheap price.

A back-alley roadside vendor typed scene where the Bugis from South Sulawesi province, Indonesia would do their trading, in the olden days. This used to be a tourist destination those days during my younger days. Today, popular spot still, against all the bigger and sophisticated malls. As time goes the STB has done a lot to upkeep the place and...


Bugis Street Markets are very hot and crowded. Many stalls all selling the same thing - cheap quality womens clothing and mobile phone accessories. A good place to go for the experience, but if it is shopping you want - there is much better around.

Bugis Street is indeed Singapore's epicentre of (cheap) shopping, and is surely a must-visit.
Depending on where you are, you can take a cab, a bus (double-check the number), or an MRT. From the MRT, you will simply pass through the mall, and cross the street to Bugis/ There you will find many stalls offering various products to choose from:...


There were tons of stalls upon stalls here. It was also ridiculously crowded. It wasn't the cheapest place to go to for souvenirs but it sure was an experience to walk around in.

The ground level of the complex sell souvenirs and delicacies. Prices are a bit cheaper and there are a lot to choose from. The upper floor and the rest is technically a girl's place. Clothes, shoes, bags, u name it! However its not the cheapest market in Asia. Markets in China and Bangkok can let you save more money.

We frequent this place very often and have still not been able to try all of the food and shopping etc. there's so many different things to do here that I'm sure there is something for everyone

Got many stalls you can visit, especially souvenirs, phone casings, or bags! There also got many malls you may shop,go there early morning for the bugis street.

Take your time to go through all the shops in the bugis village and I am sure one can find what they are looking for, at a very cheap price. You can get watches and goggles for as low as $5 and t-shirts starting from $3. IT also has shops that sells items which are over $100 as well. So,...


It is located next to Bugis MRT station, hence the ease of accessibility to the area. The newly renovated bugis village offers great buys at affordable pricing, the improved ventilation makes shopping in the crowded area more comfortable.

Enjoy Bugis Street but do take the time to explore the upper floors of the complex. Down on street level, many of the shops offer the same touristy stuff. Well, that is why we are in Bugis. But, up the levels and the shopping becomes more real. You will spend more money on ground level on touristy things. Upstairs isn't...


Nothing special here. If you're from Jakarta, I could describe it more like "mangga dua". here's a place to shop. Either it's cloth, choco, or just eating food around. Nothing special to show..
Not really recommended for babies, cos it's very crowded... Hot, and none AC..

This is obviously is the most famous recommended shopping area for tourists who are seeking for things to bring back home as a keepsake for their loved-ones. This is the place where you can get tons of Singapore keychains at a very low price (frugal as you may be). TIP: shop around first and go for the lowest deal you...


It is a amazing place to Shop as it is also called the biggest street market of Singapore. This is indeed a shopping paradise for girls as this street offers lots of good merchandise like clothes, dresses, accessories & other gift items with reasonable rates.
It is well connected to MRT, drop down at BUGIS station & 5 minutes walk...


3 floors of shop like markets. Better quality clothing than what is in the markets and lots of cheap dresses for small people like me. Will take you a good couple of hours to work your way around it. Everything is cram packed in, but make sure you barter cos you can oftern get good discounts for multi buys. Just...


It is as beautiful as chaotic, I love Bugis Street, I like his hustle his flea market where it can be found anything and for those like me who love tropical fruit really low prices.
It is not only fruit, but there is really everything, including the dozens of stalls along the way.
This is one of those typical Asian...


This is an area of mix shopping. Value for money for young and trendy, tourist as well as locals. There are many shops around here which you can pick your choices. Food is ample here and it is conveniently next to the Bugis MRT station. Spent at least 3 hours here.

Mostly cheap and low quality clothing. Suitable place to shop for party gear. A lot of touristy stuff on ground floor and low quality snacks and food aligning the pathway.
Really cramp premises and the ventilation is terrible. Almost impossible to navigate during weekends.
Should go to the adjacent mall or Bugis Junction for decent air-conditioning on a hot day...


It is average for shopping.
I expected more but this complex has about 3 storey.
Nothing much if compared to shopping experience in Seoul or Malaysia.
The prices were a bit expensive. Of course if you walk the whole building you will be able to find some cheap stuff as well.
The location is very good near to the subway....


Bustling undercover Market selling lots of touristy tat, worth a visit but don't expect any fakes or it to be like markets in Hong Kong or Thailand.. Spent an hour here just walking through then trying to find my way back to my starting point... it was packed

Bugis Village is a place where you can do shopping for cheap prices compared to other places in Singapore. With a vast and dynamic product mix, Bugis Street is well known for its wide selection, competitive prices and quality merchandise that cater to anyone and everyone.
Bugis Street currently houses about 800 shops, which makes Bugis Street the Largest Street...


This was my first visit here and went there on tripadvisor recommendations but they didn't pay it justice. This is by far my favourite part of Singapore for shopping - beats the massive shopping centres!
The street has heaps of charm with really cool artisan, vintage boutiques. Some are a little pricey but most aren't and you won't find the...


Whether its cheaps watches, clothing or food you want, head to the Bugis Street Markets and wander through the back streets. Its amazing!

Bugis was right near our hotel, spent nearly every night there since it is open until 10-11pm.
Wonderful shopping for teens and 20 somethings, especially girls. If you can bargain this is the place for you, as well as an excellent place to pick up souvenirs.
Regarding the "no trying allowed"- ask nicely as they will often let westerners try...


Bugis Street is just what markets should be. Lots of variety and the option to barter if you want. It is even better now than it was a few years ago as they have improved the air circulation which makes it a little more comfortable. You can find just about most things you would want and the only place to...


This is the market which many many people are not aware about..We found this place when we are looking on net for shopping and thought of giving it a try..The market is quite shabby like Ladies market of Hongkong or Patpong of Bangkok,But then shopping for cheap is here...U can scroll about as its a huge market and bargaining at...


If you need to buy clothes for your teens or people back home bugis is the place to go. They do sell souvenirs in bulk like a price for 24 key chains but it works out almost the same as Chinatown.

Extensive markets in and around Bugis Street. Different to other Asian markets elsewhere in that quality was a little better, was air conditioned (to some degree anyway) and no bartering/bargaining. All clothes seemed to be aimed at <30 year olds though...very little for us 50 somethings. One unique and questionable aspect was that you were expected to purchase without trying...


Shopping street it is....... but its mainly for ladies........ So visit only if you plan to shop for women...... again you will get small souveniers and also choclates in here.........

We stayed at the intercontinental so had easy access to Bugis Street. The stalls and shops are open late with a great range of souvenirs. There are plenty of cheap T-shirts, shoes, clothes etc but if you are not interested in the cheap items then just go for the atmosphere. There are also department stores in the immediate vicinity so...


Nice night ambience , just like night market. I wanted to buy I <3 SG t-shirt but it was expensive , S$15 fixed price ! I didnt buy it , I just bought another cloth. And I found that Giordano sells the original I <3 SG t shirt for S$15 too. I was so glad i didnt buy at bugis...


A must for anyone looking for some cheap holiday souvenirs to take back home.
There are lots of little shops set out in little streets under cover so no matter what the weather is you can shop away.
We did not stop for food but there is lots available and if it tastes half as good as it looks and...


There are 3 major shopping centres here, BHG, OG n ILLUMA where they sell more good quality products. There have everything from fashion wear , daily necessaries to IT products, anything you can think of, they have it here. At Bugis Village, you can get souvenirs at $2, T-Shirt at 3 for $10, Tote Bag at 4 for $10, Summer...


really good market went there twice. I prefer market shopping than department store and this market had quality clothing and shoes. Cheap watches and jewellry and was able to buy here for everyone back home

We visited this market this morning and whilst is busy and at times congested it is really good for purchasing souvenirs, presents for friends, with a large range of different stores all selling earrings, bags, Jewellery, cheap perfumes, electronic gadgets and accessories, cold juices etc... Really enjoyed buying some souvenirs to take home but you need time out afterwards! Te...


I obviously knew how expensive Singapore would be but was still shocked by the prices. So it was a welcomed surprised stumbling upon the Bugis street market with a variety of clothes, shoes, souvenirs, and other stuff that were more reasonably priced

We spent a couple of hours in these markets and didn't get to see it all. Prices are great. Good quality souvenir t-shirts for $10, or keyrings for $2 (the same they sell elsewhere for $6). If you want to supply your friends and family with souvenirs here is where you can achieve that on a budget. Oh - and...


Refreshing fruit juices available at only $1. Many shops selling clothes (as low as $5), accessories, shoes, souvenirs etc etc. Drop by if you'd like to get cheap souvenirs and clothings.

There are a lot of shopping malls in Singapore but Bugis is where you can find cheap but good finds. It is also near some hawker centers where you can eat authentic Singaporean food at an affordable price (way better than those at malls). Be ready though to walk and face the crazy crowd.

Its a place where you can get cheap and best. Get good souvenir . Bit crowded though.. Its jus outside green line and its very close to purple line as well. Shopping area. Have lots of manicurist and retail shop around.

I wouldnt say this market wasn't anything too exciting if you've done classic markets in other Asian cities yet isn't bad to check out.
We went around 8.45pm to pick up some hawkers food for a late dinner at the same time but a few of the stalls had shut up by then and a large portion of the food...


Since our hotel was located in between Little India and Bugis junction, we got to see both Little India and Bugis Village. I would describe this is more a residential area, where you can buy cheaper clothing, there are many shops and restaurants, also a huge food court that seems to be very inexpensive comparing to few other we visited,...


Went to Bugis village this june school holidays to purchase Vans shoes. As usual, it is quite a good plce to shop and lot of choices to eat.

If you dont want to shop then definitely dont go. Lots of small shops with lots of bargins.
You can also buy food items and other things you may need if you are staying a while.

Fun, full on, busy, frenetic, cheap no major shops just lots of small shops. Better atmosphere that the big sterile malls.
Spent a lot of time wandering around.

what do you do if you're a shopaholic, but on a limited budget in expensive singapore? You go to bugis, of course! Bugis is for shopaholic bargain hunters like me who get their thrills from cheapo finds and who'd sacrifice anything in the shopping--crowds, sweat, you name it! My measly shopping budget would have never survived without bugis. Orchard road...


A nice bargain shopping area worth a look. Theres also a nice chinese cuisine food court across the road.

This was a first time, i visit Bugis Street. SO excited with all the cheap goods. clothes basically are cheap. about 10-30 dollar. depend on the design and material. basically, if you can tolerate cheap goods with average quality of material, you should visit this place. it's not for people who love designer and fancy expensive things. the quality is...


Lots and lots of tiny shops but mostly selling crap and high priced crap save your time don't bother going there.
Hot and smelly

Greta place to buy anything, it's all cheap so don't expect top quality, but it provides value for money. Also has great iced drinks for a $1,as well as food and fruit. This place has been on my Singapore to do list since I first went there in 1976 (changed a bit though!)

Got its name from the Bugis people from Sulawesi, Indonesia. It serve as a trading point of the Bugis, and thats how the name came about. This is flea market or a shopping mecca for all those cheap goods or item like fake watches and women handbags. A good place to get your souvenir for giveway.


Having been to the various shopping places where everything is upmarket and expensive found this little gem.Got there on the efficient MRT.Its a little like Victoria Market in Melbourne for clothes and the like but on three floors.Cheap but ok clothes and other stuff that the tourist might want. I bought sunglasses and my wife hats.Ok we have issues but...


If you like 3 levels of crowded shopping arcades then this is the place for you. For the first 5 minutes I thought it was colorful and interesting but then the sameness of every stall hit me (phone covers, small clothes, small shoes). I am amazed that a place that is allegedly for tourists doesn't deal with shoe and clothes...


Bugis Street is a typical Asian market centre, bustling with activity and crammed full of stalls and people. The $1 juices you can buy are fantastic, as are the ice cream and wafer sandwiches. Other than the food and beverage options however, everything is fairly cheap and nasty. Fun to walk through, but I wouldn't go expecting to find any...


If you're in Singapore and you can't afford a Ferrari or a real Hermes bag and need to buy some gifts, come to Bugis St. Bugis St. is a typical jampacked shopping experience similar to Pat Pong in Bangkok or the old Tsim Sha Tsui district of Kowloon. Fighting your way through the crowds on the narrow street lined with...


The place is not far from the opposite of Bugis Junction. It is a street market with so many little shops. Huge range of products from t-shirts, keychain, bags, fridge magnet, accesories, drinks, food, etc. The price is low to average, with low to average quality. The funny part is a sex shop can also be found here=).
BTW I...


Enjoy the real Singapore shopping experience at Bugis street. From Food to Clothes to Kinky items to Souvenirs...all at a bargain.

We walked to Bugis Street from our accommodation on Raffles Boulevard and thoroughly enjoyed the market. Got quite a few cheap gifts and the $1 fresh juices were excellent.

I last came to Singapore 35 years ago and remember a very different Bugis Street. The markets are now the centre of the street and are a vibrant and colourful place to while away a few hours and pick up some bargains. Easy to get to and find your way around.

cheap and friendly market. i like this kind of market which everything just there. so much cheap clothes and dress, merchandise like 24 keychains just for 10sgd, perfect place to buy souvenir.
theres also cheap drinks and foods around 2sgd.
located on center the of singapore. its just... perfect

This place is located at the center of Singapore. One can enjoy the Street Shopping and can taste the different different cuisines of Singapore. This place a mixture of Shopping and Food Chains. One of happening place of Singapore.

The quality are better than mong Kok in hong kong. Ppl seems nicer and more comfortable than in mong kok hong kong .Price reasonable for these quality. If you want fitting room and service then go in shopping arcade . This is not what you will like. I am small build so size general ok.

i avoided the much hyped Mustafa for obvious reasons that Im not good at bargaianing. Most shops in bugis street have fixed rates and you dont feel cheated. Good ladies tops,purse available in the range of $12-20. Lots of studd in $2 to 5 range to be acrried as souveniers for folks in India

What a heaven market. Everything is cheap for souvenir.
Crowded like other market.
Stop and buy some uncle ice cream! Just 1$ to accompanying your shopping!

Was disappointed with Bugis St. The noise was a cacophony, the market stalls were all virtually 'one size fits my 5ft tweenage daughter' and nowhere to try any clothes on if you did happen to find something you might like to purchase.

Bugis street are just outside Bugis MRT. This is at its peak in the nights. Small street shops full of variety specially young girls cloths, accessories and suitable place for buying cheap Singapore souvenirs. My kids bought wrist watches and key rings. Garments have a lot of variety but a bit small for average Indian standards & also a bit...


Very busy market area, loads of the same and would appear all prices fixed, no real bartering (better in China town KL). Couldn't find the dodgy handbags/shoes/watches. Eating at the hawkers dinners is an experience worth having.

Economic shopping point in singapore, nice place to hang out with friends, god food places around, with a blessed McD at the MRT of bugis, subway is the good option at bugis mall, walled with hotel intercontinental

One of the many indoor and street shopping/retail in Singapore. Crowded with people and shopper bargaining a highlight, if you are up to it. Anything and everything you might be interested in buying. If you a shopper and bargain hunter, this might be your cup of tea. You can purchase t-shirts to tailored suits and souvenirs.

A must do in Singapore is to visit the Bugis street markets. Here you will find pretty much any knick knack item that you will need. There are a lot of the same stalls selling the same thing so it does get a little repetitious. If you need to buy a lot of souvernirs for family and friends when you...


We had not really heard of Bugis St before going to Singapore - unlike the more famous Orchard Road. However, we did our best shopping here. Great malls and clothing shops - as well as nice places to eat. Worth the short MRT ride from City Hall. We found the shopping better than Orchard Road which tends to have a...


As far as shopping goes, it's hard to beat. You have an area with a China-town like vibe (and pricing), a hawker area, while on the other end there are the posh malls. A few blocks away are the art and music shops. It can get crowded, though.

We visited in the evening and it was initially a shock the sheer number of people - but this paled into insignificance compared to just how much stuff is crammed in there.
It is not an architecturally inspired building nor, I imagine, it is up there with the cultural highs of Singapore but nonetheless it was interesting/enjoyable and we picked...


A lively colourful market area full of smells especially "Durian" fruit not everyone's dream but it is part of any market in Singapore. So many places selling clothes, all kinds of street food & juices, a riot of noise colour not a place a for a gentle stroll, more a place to absorb the atmosphere. In January like all places...

This is where we bought souvenirs to bring home. T shirts, key chains, ash trays with singapore designs, magnets.

I liked this street as it is close to Bugis Junction mall, and Bugis Traditional Market which sale many souvenirs of Singapore icon. So, for people whose like shopping, this place really recommended for you and also there are so many hotel here. I disliked for the crowded situation and abit traffic.

Pretty much has everything you are looking for. Can be a tight squeeze through as it can be very packed by both people looking and stall holders themselves. Never really saw a 'quiet time' Was staying at a hotel opposite and went through a few different times of day and was generally packed.
Worth going too for those tat souvenirs...


I found the place very average. Average stalls, average prices, averagely kept, stall holders average. A bit disappointment really. Enough said.


I visited Bugis Street in November last year and it was extremely busy. The small stores are packed in which creates a rather exciting atmosphere. However, all the shirts are very small and tiny. There are no change rooms so you basically have to guess. I didn't buy any clothing but I bought a few iPhone cases here which were...


Bugis St is nowhere near as a food as Chine Town and sells a lot of the same stuff. It's a massive in door market and is roasting and ram packed full of people. It's an experience but if your looking for bargains you will have to fight for room.

We spent some time walking round Bugis Street, live music and dancing for a festival, the weekend of 25th August 2013. There is, in particular a market, which is very busy and the stalls are closely packed in. There are signs everywhere relating to CCTV, as pickpockets are rife. Not as cheap as one would expect. But worth a trip...


We were advised to visit China Town and Little India, however, after visiting both we weren't that impressed. We then stumbled upon Bugis markets suggested by a local, 3 stories spread over a few streets, great food, great sales and great attraction. The Markets are open all day long and close around 10pm at night, the food stalls carry on...


I had a bad experienced eating durian in bugis street, they cheated me for a foam box of durian for SGD50, somehow he said SGD10, so have him my money, he said no,no eat first and pay later. Do not trust what they say and they normally TWIST their words. Pay BEFORE they open, even when they say eat first...


we thought we check these markets out, and we where amazed how nice these markets are but they are very busy, but also the prices are very reasonable if your looking for that little gift for someone, there are shops after shops, this place is well worth going to visit it is a change from the orchard road shops and...


Definitely visit Bugis for the street night market atmosphere & souvenir shopping. We visited at night & it was all undercover & not hot. Most clothing stores on 1st floor above are in a/conditioning. Lots of trendy/urban type clothing & accessories for the young ones, many souvenir shops (key rings/magnets/tshirts/costume jewellery), shoes ($15+) wallets (3 for $10) & handbags ($10)...


great atmosphere and you can buy almost anything! easy access by foot, MRT or bus, close to the city.

Our hotel concierge advised us to go to Bugis street.it was very nice advice as my wife shopped a lot and I paid reasonably.in our next visit to Singapore ,we will spend more time in Bugis street.

We heard from someone about Bugis Junction, So we went there. While walking, we saw this street. We started walking inside it and surprisingly it was really very big. We shopped a lot. We spent around 6 hours here. My wife went to every shop and she always found something new to buy. Really great market.

If you are in the neighbourhood it is well worth visiting for the hustle and bustle of a street market. Be wary of pickpockets.

You could find almost everything from this place, and a great shopping area to find cheap souvenirs. you could find 4 for $10 t-shirts, keychain and any other stuffs which mostly sold 3 for $10. Prepare yourself to get sweaty though..

Bags, sun glasses, souvenirs and many stuffs with affordable price. 24 prices of Singapore iconic keychain only for 10SGD, 4 handbags also 10SGD. Try to going around this street before decide which shop that have a good deal for you (good quality with affordable price).

Imagine your local major flea market, then double its size and treble the number of customers. Yes, there is bucketloads of stuff to buy (occidentals will struggle to be the right size for clothing), but remember it is a flea market; quality will be difficult to find.

This is a nice place to get cheap stuff but it's too hot and stuffy. The crowd gets worst during weekends. So expect thousand of people and a big squeeze. Come prepared to sweat and getting the heat!
Would be really nice of its cooler.

Loved these markets. Visited them twice as it was hard to get it all in on one go. They do get very crowded though so can be difficult for families with small children and prams. Everything from fashion, souvenirs and food. A must see.

my favorite block in singapore hands down. Visited here first in 2011, then came back last month to find out it's now bigger than before. For people who has anxiety among crowds, I don't recommend this. but for those who have no problem moving back and forth in tiny space crowded with people, then this is it. Found the cheap...


One of the most important stuff to bring back home whenever you are on a holiday is souvenir; be it fridge magnet, key-chain, t-shirt etc. and I bet this place is among the favorite spot by many tourists who visited Singapore. Every souvenirs you can find in one (crowded) place. Easy access via the MRT and a proper Hylam Mall...


A lot of very cheap clothes and souvenirs
Very manic on the weekends but still an experience. Get some cash before you got through the markets as everything is cash.
Good street style food and juice bars.
It's an experience worth doing and it's full of clothes for the kids and women not so much for guys.
Try to go...


This place is packed however a must visit for anyone visiting singapore. Its an experience. Very busy all the time. Some great souvenirs available at great prices.

Check out the map and you will see there are plenty of places to visit after you have passed bugis street. For instance, there's the famous local temple, called the Guan Yin Temple. The new shopping mall Bugis + ( can catch a movie there, or drink a cup of koi bubble tea ). Then walk a little further to...


If you look for souvenirs of singapore with a good price, come to Bugis street. Although the quality is not great but can't say bad. It is OK if you need to buy lots of souvenirs.
When the first time I visited Bugis street back to 10-15 years ago, I even could bargain to 40% discount. However the last visit...


The place is small, then it's so crowded and if you are budget shopper, it's a good choice to shop there, and you can buy souvenir there ( there's a lot of promotion ). But, if you don't like to shop or sightseeing in crowded place, better find other place to shop

We chose to stay near Bugis Village since we live to shop for cheap but nice stuff. There are plenty of shops which sells nice and funky clothes as well as shoes and sandals. Since my kids are teen agers and shopping at Orchard Road is quite expensive, this place is a good alternative. When taking the MRT, alight at...


Bugis street is right outside Bugis Station. So train is the best mode of travel. Around 800 shops under one roof and a huge range of variety is available for shoppers.
Best time to visit is around 11am since it is not that crowded. Have a look at everything first and then decide to buy. Same product will have different...


Great undercover airconditioned market place selling lots of cheap goods and many souvenirs. Great atmosphere although a bit crowded. Worth a visit for sure!

Last time I was in Bugis srt, was in 59 and 62. what a change, it was full of ladies, trouble was you couldn't tell the difference, between a real one or a ladyboy, unless you did a mick dundee

Bugis street, i can spend my whole afternoon here looking for souvenirs and cute accessories. However, i find the souvenir (fridge or key chain) cheaper in Chinatown. You may also walk to the Guan Yin temple and do some prayer.

Bugis Street is a unique retail shopping destination. After undergoing a major facelift, Bugis Street now houses almost 800 shops, making it the largest street shopping location in Singapore. With a vast and dynamic product mix, Bugis Street is well known for its wide selection, competitive prices and quality merchandise that cater to anyone and everyone. The entire street came...


Really lovely place to shop! Compared to malls, this is fairly cheaper. I bought all my stuff here, with the exception of some stuff from Typo store.
Highly recommended to budget travelers! But before you buy anything, make sure to check each stall first! That's what I did, and good thing I did that because I saw cheaper version of...


If you are looking for women's fashion it's great, if you are slim. You are not able to try anything on which makes it difficult. The prices are cheap so it's not a big loss if you buy something you can't wear. My husband was disappointed because there were not many places to buy mens clothing and it was all...


It is a shoppers paradise. Absolutely loved it!!! All local stuff at really cheap prices. But the quality is great.
Its a huge huge market so look out for every turn you take. I was lost.

This marketplace was air conditioned which surprised me as most markets do not have air conditioning. This market caters for young girls fashion (mostly all one size fits all) and some men's clothing but bare in mind, they have a policy where you cannot try it on. There are heaps of cheap souvenirs and the fresh juice is really cheap...


Bugis street is now one massive indoor market place selling nearly everything you can think of. many many stalls of souvenirs, much like China town (3 for $10) and also many stalls for clothing.
if you don't like massive crowds or shopping its probably not somewhere you should go.

Bugis is Harajuku - Singapore version, in here u must slight to choose what ever u buy...
sometimes is more expensive than usually, so u must bargain as u can , example for the dress them hang in the price is SGD 10 , u can less it like SGD 8 .. the cheapest store in ground , the ground...


Bugis Street is one massive indoor flea market, spanning 3 floors across two buildings. Most of it is indoor and air conditioned, but some stalls have spilled out and over into the adjacent buildings and roads. There are some souvenir stalls along the first floor, but majority of the stalls here cater to young girls' fashion. Most novelty items can...


many merchandise you can choose here e.g watch, umbrella, clothes, keychain, etc. They also sell snacks if you hungry or fast food restaurant when you walk out here and it only take 3 or 4 minutes to get there.

Visited during the day in July about 36 degrees which means it was very hot inside! this market sells all matter of things but lots of stalls selling the same items! some good fashion for the youngies as long as you are a small size. Lots of junky souvenir items, such as key holders etc. nothing of quality available from...



a place have many products from china. the place is always crowded with people trading. the items are much cheaper shopping in the mall.

I always shop here when I went to Singapore. Buy some souvenir with reasonable price (most of them are S$10 for 3 items). If you buy more just ask them for discount, they will happily give you some discount. The food court have so many choice of food. Its just 2 minutes walk from Bugis MRT.

It is a crowded place. Lots of food store(worth to try) and there is lots of store to shop and buy.. they have anything u want like bag, shirt, wallet, dress and etc...... And most importantly everything there is selling at a affordable price.. if u buy more they might even give u discount.
lastly,If u don't like the place...


large flea market type shops.Noisy,crowded fun booths. prices not that good but fun to haggle with shopkeepers. Great juice stands with large glasses of juice for $1

Many thinks to see, shop and eat, ... a great place to hangout and spend the time there. Awesome for street photography, colourfull thinks, food, and character make a rich pictures was taken. Enjoying BUGIS STREET !

Bugis Street, with small shops lined along its both sides is a place where you can check out shirts and other fashion accessories at affordable prices. Even then, these "affordable" prices can still be haggled if you have excellent bargaining skills. Vendors here really put up a good slice of margin since all who buy at this place almost always...


You can find many small shops here ... cloths, bags, shoes, accessories, IT, Gadgets and much more. You can bargain if you want.

best place in Singapore for t shirts and cheaper none designer clothes, shoes and bags. best in the early morning or evening, gets very hot and very crowded

Way back in time (the 1960's or so) Bugis St was somewhat known as the place in Singapore where, when it came to the women, there might have been more than met the eye in the trouser department. Those days are long gone.
All that is left is the other thing that was here then, a huge bunch of market...


This was my first visit here and went there on tripadvisor recommendations but they didn't pay it justice. This is by far my favourite part of Singapore for shopping - beats the massive shopping centres!
The street has heaps of charm with really cool artisan, vintage boutiques. Some are a little pricey but most aren't and you won't find the...


Whether its cheaps watches, clothing or food you want, head to the Bugis Street Markets and wander through the back streets. Its amazing!

Bugis was right near our hotel, spent nearly every night there since it is open until 10-11pm.
Wonderful shopping for teens and 20 somethings, especially girls. If you can bargain this is the place for you, as well as an excellent place to pick up souvenirs.
Regarding the "no trying allowed"- ask nicely as they will often let westerners try...


Bugis Street is just what markets should be. Lots of variety and the option to barter if you want. It is even better now than it was a few years ago as they have improved the air circulation which makes it a little more comfortable. You can find just about most things you would want and the only place to...


This is the market which many many people are not aware about..We found this place when we are looking on net for shopping and thought of giving it a try..The market is quite shabby like Ladies market of Hongkong or Patpong of Bangkok,But then shopping for cheap is here...U can scroll about as its a huge market and bargaining at...


If you need to buy clothes for your teens or people back home bugis is the place to go. They do sell souvenirs in bulk like a price for 24 key chains but it works out almost the same as Chinatown.

Extensive markets in and around Bugis Street. Different to other Asian markets elsewhere in that quality was a little better, was air conditioned (to some degree anyway) and no bartering/bargaining. All clothes seemed to be aimed at <30 year olds though...very little for us 50 somethings. One unique and questionable aspect was that you were expected to purchase without trying...


Shopping street it is....... but its mainly for ladies........ So visit only if you plan to shop for women...... again you will get small souveniers and also choclates in here.........

We stayed at the intercontinental so had easy access to Bugis Street. The stalls and shops are open late with a great range of souvenirs. There are plenty of cheap T-shirts, shoes, clothes etc but if you are not interested in the cheap items then just go for the atmosphere. There are also department stores in the immediate vicinity so...


Nice night ambience , just like night market. I wanted to buy I <3 SG t-shirt but it was expensive , S$15 fixed price ! I didnt buy it , I just bought another cloth. And I found that Giordano sells the original I <3 SG t shirt for S$15 too. I was so glad i didnt buy at bugis...


We love Bugis,stay in Sing for 5 days , came here 7 times, I have my first tatoo here, we have been offer really Big promotion when shopping in Bugis+. We are broke now .

It was a bit interesting, but it's very crowded and they mainly sell cheap junk and fakes. made in China", silly statement t-shirts sayng things like "University of Michigan Goldfish", also the ware is quite repetitive. Most of the stuff is "one size fits all", and they don't let you try it, but those sizes are for asians, and looked...


Bugis has always been a place for everyone. The unique fountain entertain the kids, shop as much as you can with better deals or simply hang out to kill your time. We have always had fun enjoying the water fountain, getting wet and watching kids place around.

The place to go for local sites and shopping of all sorts. I go there for the fresh market and rocks and minerals stores

This place is not hard to find ;). If you are a budget-conscious tourist, this is the place for you! This is like 168 shopping plaza in the Philippines where you can find and buy various
things like cheap bags; t-shirts, caps, sun
glasses. Though you could find there some
branded stores also that suits your taste! ;)

This is one of the liveliest and busy shopping area, which I came across. A complete paradise for people who love to shop and bargain. You can find anything and everything here with repeated shops and different variety. A lot of discounts were going on, when I visited and picked up quite a few things for gifting apart from shopping...


A shopping heaven, Bugis Village has everything from clothing, jeans, accessories, even adult shop. Variety of food and drinks also available and

This is the liviest shopping street in Singapore , you can find everything from clothing ,wathes , cosmetics, foods and drinks , frankly speaking almost anything with bargainable price.Its a 4 storey street mall and you all shops from bottom to top have a distictive merchandise.Near to the Bugis Junction , Bugis + shopping mall.Accessible from any part of Singapore...


Interesting places to shop that sells a variety of goods ranging from souvenirs to clothes. Feel free to bargain to get the best price, if you are tired of shopping, there are also a lot of drink and snack vending. Maybe this is a paradise for shopping lovers. Located opposite and close enough to the MRT station, to be able...


If you like market shopping you will be disappointed, if you don't like market shopping don't even bother. Remember they don't open until 10-11 and its the same thing over and over again. Lots of watches, t shirts, hair accessories, and phone cases. There are a lot of food stalls which is probably the only good thing about it.

Take the MRT to Bugis station and check out Bugis Village as I doubt that you would be too disappointed. Busy with many shopping, browsing, eating and drinking options. My fave was grabbing fresh fruit juices at good prices ($1 SGD) or sit down and have a mango smoothie at one of the cafes along the pedestrian strip which afford...


Fortunately we stopped here early afternoon and had a quick walk around the market. The guide books seem to rave about it but it is really tacky with nothing worth buying. Many more interesting places in Singapore.
The one saving grace was that we found a good food court just outside Bugis Street MRT

Had an amazing time shopping in this area. Please explore the whole market before buying anything as they have some amazing variety and some good deals . Do explore the kstree which is just above .

Very huge place for shopping cheap clothes, watches, sovereigner etc
The entire place cannot be covered in a day. BAWARE that the place is really crowded

I have visited the market several times for the buzz. Its always bright and colourful. However, there is nothing in my size - even Asian XL is at best a European L and often only M.

Crazy busy, especially at weekends but good fun. You can buy cheap souvenirs and clothing for next to nothing.

We were advised to visit China Town and Little India, however, after visiting both we weren't that impressed. We then stumbled upon Bugis markets suggested by a local, 3 stories spread over a few streets, great food, great sales and great attraction. The Markets are open all day long and close around 10pm at night, the food stalls carry on...


Spent a fair bit of time at Bugis Street. Certainly if I had an unlimited budget and no clothes I might have found it more interesting but apart from that it was just a nice place to walk through.

Decided to go here after hearing a lot from my friends. Well - for guys - better avoid, its a ladies shopping area and mostly sovereigns. if you are looking for cheap watches and fresh fruit drinks this is the place. Be prepared to face the rush as it gets crowded very soon especially on weekends. With my experience -...


Located in front of Bugis Junction Mall, Bugis street is easily accessible.
you can buy souvenirs and chlotes, bags etc. with a very cheap price.

Nothing special here. If you're from Jakarta, I could describe it more like "mangga dua". here's a place to shop. Either it's cloth, choco, or just eating food around. Nothing special to show..
Not really recommended for babies, cos it's very crowded... Hot, and none AC..

This is obviously is the most famous recommended shopping area for tourists who are seeking for things to bring back home as a keepsake for their loved-ones. This is the place where you can get tons of Singapore keychains at a very low price (frugal as you may be). TIP: shop around first and go for the lowest deal you...


It is a amazing place to Shop as it is also called the biggest street market of Singapore. This is indeed a shopping paradise for girls as this street offers lots of good merchandise like clothes, dresses, accessories & other gift items with reasonable rates.
It is well connected to MRT, drop down at BUGIS station & 5 minutes walk...


3 floors of shop like markets. Better quality clothing than what is in the markets and lots of cheap dresses for small people like me. Will take you a good couple of hours to work your way around it. Everything is cram packed in, but make sure you barter cos you can oftern get good discounts for multi buys. Just...


It is as beautiful as chaotic, I love Bugis Street, I like his hustle his flea market where it can be found anything and for those like me who love tropical fruit really low prices.
It is not only fruit, but there is really everything, including the dozens of stalls along the way.
This is one of those typical Asian...


This is an area of mix shopping. Value for money for young and trendy, tourist as well as locals. There are many shops around here which you can pick your choices. Food is ample here and it is conveniently next to the Bugis MRT station. Spent at least 3 hours here.

Mostly cheap and low quality clothing. Suitable place to shop for party gear. A lot of touristy stuff on ground floor and low quality snacks and food aligning the pathway.
Really cramp premises and the ventilation is terrible. Almost impossible to navigate during weekends.
Should go to the adjacent mall or Bugis Junction for decent air-conditioning on a hot day...


It is average for shopping.
I expected more but this complex has about 3 storey.
Nothing much if compared to shopping experience in Seoul or Malaysia.
The prices were a bit expensive. Of course if you walk the whole building you will be able to find some cheap stuff as well.
The location is very good near to the subway....


Bustling undercover Market selling lots of touristy tat, worth a visit but don't expect any fakes or it to be like markets in Hong Kong or Thailand.. Spent an hour here just walking through then trying to find my way back to my starting point... it was packed

Bugis Village is a place where you can do shopping for cheap prices compared to other places in Singapore. With a vast and dynamic product mix, Bugis Street is well known for its wide selection, competitive prices and quality merchandise that cater to anyone and everyone.
Bugis Street currently houses about 800 shops, which makes Bugis Street the Largest Street...


A must for anyone looking for some cheap holiday souvenirs to take back home.
There are lots of little shops set out in little streets under cover so no matter what the weather is you can shop away.
We did not stop for food but there is lots available and if it tastes half as good as it looks and...


There are 3 major shopping centres here, BHG, OG n ILLUMA where they sell more good quality products. There have everything from fashion wear , daily necessaries to IT products, anything you can think of, they have it here. At Bugis Village, you can get souvenirs at $2, T-Shirt at 3 for $10, Tote Bag at 4 for $10, Summer...


really good market went there twice. I prefer market shopping than department store and this market had quality clothing and shoes. Cheap watches and jewellry and was able to buy here for everyone back home

We visited this market this morning and whilst is busy and at times congested it is really good for purchasing souvenirs, presents for friends, with a large range of different stores all selling earrings, bags, Jewellery, cheap perfumes, electronic gadgets and accessories, cold juices etc... Really enjoyed buying some souvenirs to take home but you need time out afterwards! Te...


I obviously knew how expensive Singapore would be but was still shocked by the prices. So it was a welcomed surprised stumbling upon the Bugis street market with a variety of clothes, shoes, souvenirs, and other stuff that were more reasonably priced

We spent a couple of hours in these markets and didn't get to see it all. Prices are great. Good quality souvenir t-shirts for $10, or keyrings for $2 (the same they sell elsewhere for $6). If you want to supply your friends and family with souvenirs here is where you can achieve that on a budget. Oh - and...


Refreshing fruit juices available at only $1. Many shops selling clothes (as low as $5), accessories, shoes, souvenirs etc etc. Drop by if you'd like to get cheap souvenirs and clothings.

There are a lot of shopping malls in Singapore but Bugis is where you can find cheap but good finds. It is also near some hawker centers where you can eat authentic Singaporean food at an affordable price (way better than those at malls). Be ready though to walk and face the crazy crowd.

Its a place where you can get cheap and best. Get good souvenir . Bit crowded though.. Its jus outside green line and its very close to purple line as well. Shopping area. Have lots of manicurist and retail shop around.

I wouldnt say this market wasn't anything too exciting if you've done classic markets in other Asian cities yet isn't bad to check out.
We went around 8.45pm to pick up some hawkers food for a late dinner at the same time but a few of the stalls had shut up by then and a large portion of the food...


Since our hotel was located in between Little India and Bugis junction, we got to see both Little India and Bugis Village. I would describe this is more a residential area, where you can buy cheaper clothing, there are many shops and restaurants, also a huge food court that seems to be very inexpensive comparing to few other we visited,...


Went to Bugis village this june school holidays to purchase Vans shoes. As usual, it is quite a good plce to shop and lot of choices to eat.

If you dont want to shop then definitely dont go. Lots of small shops with lots of bargins.
You can also buy food items and other things you may need if you are staying a while.

Fun, full on, busy, frenetic, cheap no major shops just lots of small shops. Better atmosphere that the big sterile malls.
Spent a lot of time wandering around.

what do you do if you're a shopaholic, but on a limited budget in expensive singapore? You go to bugis, of course! Bugis is for shopaholic bargain hunters like me who get their thrills from cheapo finds and who'd sacrifice anything in the shopping--crowds, sweat, you name it! My measly shopping budget would have never survived without bugis. Orchard road...


A nice bargain shopping area worth a look. Theres also a nice chinese cuisine food court across the road.

This was a first time, i visit Bugis Street. SO excited with all the cheap goods. clothes basically are cheap. about 10-30 dollar. depend on the design and material. basically, if you can tolerate cheap goods with average quality of material, you should visit this place. it's not for people who love designer and fancy expensive things. the quality is...


Lots and lots of tiny shops but mostly selling crap and high priced crap save your time don't bother going there.
Hot and smelly

Greta place to buy anything, it's all cheap so don't expect top quality, but it provides value for money. Also has great iced drinks for a $1,as well as food and fruit. This place has been on my Singapore to do list since I first went there in 1976 (changed a bit though!)

Got its name from the Bugis people from Sulawesi, Indonesia. It serve as a trading point of the Bugis, and thats how the name came about. This is flea market or a shopping mecca for all those cheap goods or item like fake watches and women handbags. A good place to get your souvenir for giveway.

A back-alley roadside vendor typed scene where the Bugis from South Sulawesi province, Indonesia would do their trading, in the olden days. This used to be a tourist destination those days during my younger days. Today, popular spot still, against all the bigger and sophisticated malls. As time goes the STB has done a lot to upkeep the place and...


Bugis Street Markets are very hot and crowded. Many stalls all selling the same thing - cheap quality womens clothing and mobile phone accessories. A good place to go for the experience, but if it is shopping you want - there is much better around.

Bugis Street is indeed Singapore's epicentre of (cheap) shopping, and is surely a must-visit.
Depending on where you are, you can take a cab, a bus (double-check the number), or an MRT. From the MRT, you will simply pass through the mall, and cross the street to Bugis/ There you will find many stalls offering various products to choose from:...


There were tons of stalls upon stalls here. It was also ridiculously crowded. It wasn't the cheapest place to go to for souvenirs but it sure was an experience to walk around in.

The ground level of the complex sell souvenirs and delicacies. Prices are a bit cheaper and there are a lot to choose from. The upper floor and the rest is technically a girl's place. Clothes, shoes, bags, u name it! However its not the cheapest market in Asia. Markets in China and Bangkok can let you save more money.

We frequent this place very often and have still not been able to try all of the food and shopping etc. there's so many different things to do here that I'm sure there is something for everyone

Got many stalls you can visit, especially souvenirs, phone casings, or bags! There also got many malls you may shop,go there early morning for the bugis street.

Take your time to go through all the shops in the bugis village and I am sure one can find what they are looking for, at a very cheap price. You can get watches and goggles for as low as $5 and t-shirts starting from $3. IT also has shops that sells items which are over $100 as well. So,...


It is located next to Bugis MRT station, hence the ease of accessibility to the area. The newly renovated bugis village offers great buys at affordable pricing, the improved ventilation makes shopping in the crowded area more comfortable.

Enjoy Bugis Street but do take the time to explore the upper floors of the complex. Down on street level, many of the shops offer the same touristy stuff. Well, that is why we are in Bugis. But, up the levels and the shopping becomes more real. You will spend more money on ground level on touristy things. Upstairs isn't...


Our hotel concierge advised us to go to Bugis street.it was very nice advice as my wife shopped a lot and I paid reasonably.in our next visit to Singapore ,we will spend more time in Bugis street.

We heard from someone about Bugis Junction, So we went there. While walking, we saw this street. We started walking inside it and surprisingly it was really very big. We shopped a lot. We spent around 6 hours here. My wife went to every shop and she always found something new to buy. Really great market.

If you are in the neighbourhood it is well worth visiting for the hustle and bustle of a street market. Be wary of pickpockets.

You could find almost everything from this place, and a great shopping area to find cheap souvenirs. you could find 4 for $10 t-shirts, keychain and any other stuffs which mostly sold 3 for $10. Prepare yourself to get sweaty though..

Bags, sun glasses, souvenirs and many stuffs with affordable price. 24 prices of Singapore iconic keychain only for 10SGD, 4 handbags also 10SGD. Try to going around this street before decide which shop that have a good deal for you (good quality with affordable price).

Imagine your local major flea market, then double its size and treble the number of customers. Yes, there is bucketloads of stuff to buy (occidentals will struggle to be the right size for clothing), but remember it is a flea market; quality will be difficult to find.

This is a nice place to get cheap stuff but it's too hot and stuffy. The crowd gets worst during weekends. So expect thousand of people and a big squeeze. Come prepared to sweat and getting the heat!
Would be really nice of its cooler.

Loved these markets. Visited them twice as it was hard to get it all in on one go. They do get very crowded though so can be difficult for families with small children and prams. Everything from fashion, souvenirs and food. A must see.

my favorite block in singapore hands down. Visited here first in 2011, then came back last month to find out it's now bigger than before. For people who has anxiety among crowds, I don't recommend this. but for those who have no problem moving back and forth in tiny space crowded with people, then this is it. Found the cheap...


One of the most important stuff to bring back home whenever you are on a holiday is souvenir; be it fridge magnet, key-chain, t-shirt etc. and I bet this place is among the favorite spot by many tourists who visited Singapore. Every souvenirs you can find in one (crowded) place. Easy access via the MRT and a proper Hylam Mall...

We had not really heard of Bugis St before going to Singapore - unlike the more famous Orchard Road. However, we did our best shopping here. Great malls and clothing shops - as well as nice places to eat. Worth the short MRT ride from City Hall. We found the shopping better than Orchard Road which tends to have a...


As far as shopping goes, it's hard to beat. You have an area with a China-town like vibe (and pricing), a hawker area, while on the other end there are the posh malls. A few blocks away are the art and music shops. It can get crowded, though.

We visited in the evening and it was initially a shock the sheer number of people - but this paled into insignificance compared to just how much stuff is crammed in there.
It is not an architecturally inspired building nor, I imagine, it is up there with the cultural highs of Singapore but nonetheless it was interesting/enjoyable and we picked...


A lively colourful market area full of smells especially "Durian" fruit not everyone's dream but it is part of any market in Singapore. So many places selling clothes, all kinds of street food & juices, a riot of noise colour not a place a for a gentle stroll, more a place to absorb the atmosphere. In January like all places...


One may read about the history of Bugis Street in the Wikipedia article of the same name, and in a number of Weblogs recalling history (and personal histories) associated with the original Bugis Street. The original Bugis Street was a unique "walking street" for eating, drinking, and people-watching. Arguably one of "the things to do in Singapore" in the 1960s...


This is where we bought souvenirs to bring home. T shirts, key chains, ash trays with singapore designs, magnets.

I liked this street as it is close to Bugis Junction mall, and Bugis Traditional Market which sale many souvenirs of Singapore icon. So, for people whose like shopping, this place really recommended for you and also there are so many hotel here. I disliked for the crowded situation and abit traffic.

Pretty much has everything you are looking for. Can be a tight squeeze through as it can be very packed by both people looking and stall holders themselves. Never really saw a 'quiet time' Was staying at a hotel opposite and went through a few different times of day and was generally packed.
Worth going too for those tat souvenirs...


I found the place very average. Average stalls, average prices, averagely kept, stall holders average. A bit disappointment really. Enough said.


I visited Bugis Street in November last year and it was extremely busy. The small stores are packed in which creates a rather exciting atmosphere. However, all the shirts are very small and tiny. There are no change rooms so you basically have to guess. I didn't buy any clothing but I bought a few iPhone cases here which were...


Bugis St is nowhere near as a food as Chine Town and sells a lot of the same stuff. It's a massive in door market and is roasting and ram packed full of people. It's an experience but if your looking for bargains you will have to fight for room.

We spent some time walking round Bugis Street, live music and dancing for a festival, the weekend of 25th August 2013. There is, in particular a market, which is very busy and the stalls are closely packed in. There are signs everywhere relating to CCTV, as pickpockets are rife. Not as cheap as one would expect. But worth a trip...


We were advised to visit China Town and Little India, however, after visiting both we weren't that impressed. We then stumbled upon Bugis markets suggested by a local, 3 stories spread over a few streets, great food, great sales and great attraction. The Markets are open all day long and close around 10pm at night, the food stalls carry on...


I had a bad experienced eating durian in bugis street, they cheated me for a foam box of durian for SGD50, somehow he said SGD10, so have him my money, he said no,no eat first and pay later. Do not trust what they say and they normally TWIST their words. Pay BEFORE they open, even when they say eat first...


we thought we check these markets out, and we where amazed how nice these markets are but they are very busy, but also the prices are very reasonable if your looking for that little gift for someone, there are shops after shops, this place is well worth going to visit it is a change from the orchard road shops and...


Definitely visit Bugis for the street night market atmosphere & souvenir shopping. We visited at night & it was all undercover & not hot. Most clothing stores on 1st floor above are in a/conditioning. Lots of trendy/urban type clothing & accessories for the young ones, many souvenir shops (key rings/magnets/tshirts/costume jewellery), shoes ($15+) wallets (3 for $10) & handbags ($10)...


great atmosphere and you can buy almost anything! easy access by foot, MRT or bus, close to the city.

A lot of very cheap clothes and souvenirs
Very manic on the weekends but still an experience. Get some cash before you got through the markets as everything is cash.
Good street style food and juice bars.
It's an experience worth doing and it's full of clothes for the kids and women not so much for guys.
Try to go...


This place is packed however a must visit for anyone visiting singapore. Its an experience. Very busy all the time. Some great souvenirs available at great prices.

Check out the map and you will see there are plenty of places to visit after you have passed bugis street. For instance, there's the famous local temple, called the Guan Yin Temple. The new shopping mall Bugis + ( can catch a movie there, or drink a cup of koi bubble tea ). Then walk a little further to...


If you look for souvenirs of singapore with a good price, come to Bugis street. Although the quality is not great but can't say bad. It is OK if you need to buy lots of souvenirs.
When the first time I visited Bugis street back to 10-15 years ago, I even could bargain to 40% discount. However the last visit...


The place is small, then it's so crowded and if you are budget shopper, it's a good choice to shop there, and you can buy souvenir there ( there's a lot of promotion ). But, if you don't like to shop or sightseeing in crowded place, better find other place to shop

We chose to stay near Bugis Village since we live to shop for cheap but nice stuff. There are plenty of shops which sells nice and funky clothes as well as shoes and sandals. Since my kids are teen agers and shopping at Orchard Road is quite expensive, this place is a good alternative. When taking the MRT, alight at...


Bugis street is right outside Bugis Station. So train is the best mode of travel. Around 800 shops under one roof and a huge range of variety is available for shoppers.
Best time to visit is around 11am since it is not that crowded. Have a look at everything first and then decide to buy. Same product will have different...


Great undercover airconditioned market place selling lots of cheap goods and many souvenirs. Great atmosphere although a bit crowded. Worth a visit for sure!

Last time I was in Bugis srt, was in 59 and 62. what a change, it was full of ladies, trouble was you couldn't tell the difference, between a real one or a ladyboy, unless you did a mick dundee

Bugis street, i can spend my whole afternoon here looking for souvenirs and cute accessories. However, i find the souvenir (fridge or key chain) cheaper in Chinatown. You may also walk to the Guan Yin temple and do some prayer.

Bugis Street is a unique retail shopping destination. After undergoing a major facelift, Bugis Street now houses almost 800 shops, making it the largest street shopping location in Singapore. With a vast and dynamic product mix, Bugis Street is well known for its wide selection, competitive prices and quality merchandise that cater to anyone and everyone. The entire street came...


Really lovely place to shop! Compared to malls, this is fairly cheaper. I bought all my stuff here, with the exception of some stuff from Typo store.
Highly recommended to budget travelers! But before you buy anything, make sure to check each stall first! That's what I did, and good thing I did that because I saw cheaper version of...


If you are looking for women's fashion it's great, if you are slim. You are not able to try anything on which makes it difficult. The prices are cheap so it's not a big loss if you buy something you can't wear. My husband was disappointed because there were not many places to buy mens clothing and it was all...


It is a shoppers paradise. Absolutely loved it!!! All local stuff at really cheap prices. But the quality is great.
Its a huge huge market so look out for every turn you take. I was lost.

This marketplace was air conditioned which surprised me as most markets do not have air conditioning. This market caters for young girls fashion (mostly all one size fits all) and some men's clothing but bare in mind, they have a policy where you cannot try it on. There are heaps of cheap souvenirs and the fresh juice is really cheap...


Bugis street is now one massive indoor market place selling nearly everything you can think of. many many stalls of souvenirs, much like China town (3 for $10) and also many stalls for clothing.
if you don't like massive crowds or shopping its probably not somewhere you should go.

Bugis is Harajuku - Singapore version, in here u must slight to choose what ever u buy...
sometimes is more expensive than usually, so u must bargain as u can , example for the dress them hang in the price is SGD 10 , u can less it like SGD 8 .. the cheapest store in ground , the ground...


Bugis Street is one massive indoor flea market, spanning 3 floors across two buildings. Most of it is indoor and air conditioned, but some stalls have spilled out and over into the adjacent buildings and roads. There are some souvenir stalls along the first floor, but majority of the stalls here cater to young girls' fashion. Most novelty items can...


many merchandise you can choose here e.g watch, umbrella, clothes, keychain, etc. They also sell snacks if you hungry or fast food restaurant when you walk out here and it only take 3 or 4 minutes to get there.

Visited during the day in July about 36 degrees which means it was very hot inside! this market sells all matter of things but lots of stalls selling the same items! some good fashion for the youngies as long as you are a small size. Lots of junky souvenir items, such as key holders etc. nothing of quality available from...


This place is located at the center of Singapore. One can enjoy the Street Shopping and can taste the different different cuisines of Singapore. This place a mixture of Shopping and Food Chains. One of happening place of Singapore.

The quality are better than mong Kok in hong kong. Ppl seems nicer and more comfortable than in mong kok hong kong .Price reasonable for these quality. If you want fitting room and service then go in shopping arcade . This is not what you will like. I am small build so size general ok.

i avoided the much hyped Mustafa for obvious reasons that Im not good at bargaianing. Most shops in bugis street have fixed rates and you dont feel cheated. Good ladies tops,purse available in the range of $12-20. Lots of studd in $2 to 5 range to be acrried as souveniers for folks in India

What a heaven market. Everything is cheap for souvenir.
Crowded like other market.
Stop and buy some uncle ice cream! Just 1$ to accompanying your shopping!

Was disappointed with Bugis St. The noise was a cacophony, the market stalls were all virtually 'one size fits my 5ft tweenage daughter' and nowhere to try any clothes on if you did happen to find something you might like to purchase.

Bugis street are just outside Bugis MRT. This is at its peak in the nights. Small street shops full of variety specially young girls cloths, accessories and suitable place for buying cheap Singapore souvenirs. My kids bought wrist watches and key rings. Garments have a lot of variety but a bit small for average Indian standards & also a bit...


Very busy market area, loads of the same and would appear all prices fixed, no real bartering (better in China town KL). Couldn't find the dodgy handbags/shoes/watches. Eating at the hawkers dinners is an experience worth having.

Economic shopping point in singapore, nice place to hang out with friends, god food places around, with a blessed McD at the MRT of bugis, subway is the good option at bugis mall, walled with hotel intercontinental

One of the many indoor and street shopping/retail in Singapore. Crowded with people and shopper bargaining a highlight, if you are up to it. Anything and everything you might be interested in buying. If you a shopper and bargain hunter, this might be your cup of tea. You can purchase t-shirts to tailored suits and souvenirs.

A must do in Singapore is to visit the Bugis street markets. Here you will find pretty much any knick knack item that you will need. There are a lot of the same stalls selling the same thing so it does get a little repetitious. If you need to buy a lot of souvernirs for family and friends when you...



Having been to the various shopping places where everything is upmarket and expensive found this little gem.Got there on the efficient MRT.Its a little like Victoria Market in Melbourne for clothes and the like but on three floors.Cheap but ok clothes and other stuff that the tourist might want. I bought sunglasses and my wife hats.Ok we have issues but...


If you like 3 levels of crowded shopping arcades then this is the place for you. For the first 5 minutes I thought it was colorful and interesting but then the sameness of every stall hit me (phone covers, small clothes, small shoes). I am amazed that a place that is allegedly for tourists doesn't deal with shoe and clothes...


Bugis Street is a typical Asian market centre, bustling with activity and crammed full of stalls and people. The $1 juices you can buy are fantastic, as are the ice cream and wafer sandwiches. Other than the food and beverage options however, everything is fairly cheap and nasty. Fun to walk through, but I wouldn't go expecting to find any...


If you're in Singapore and you can't afford a Ferrari or a real Hermes bag and need to buy some gifts, come to Bugis St. Bugis St. is a typical jampacked shopping experience similar to Pat Pong in Bangkok or the old Tsim Sha Tsui district of Kowloon. Fighting your way through the crowds on the narrow street lined with...


The place is not far from the opposite of Bugis Junction. It is a street market with so many little shops. Huge range of products from t-shirts, keychain, bags, fridge magnet, accesories, drinks, food, etc. The price is low to average, with low to average quality. The funny part is a sex shop can also be found here=).
BTW I...


Enjoy the real Singapore shopping experience at Bugis street. From Food to Clothes to Kinky items to Souvenirs...all at a bargain.

We walked to Bugis Street from our accommodation on Raffles Boulevard and thoroughly enjoyed the market. Got quite a few cheap gifts and the $1 fresh juices were excellent.

I last came to Singapore 35 years ago and remember a very different Bugis Street. The markets are now the centre of the street and are a vibrant and colourful place to while away a few hours and pick up some bargains. Easy to get to and find your way around.

cheap and friendly market. i like this kind of market which everything just there. so much cheap clothes and dress, merchandise like 24 keychains just for 10sgd, perfect place to buy souvenir.
theres also cheap drinks and foods around 2sgd.
located on center the of singapore. its just... perfect

This was my first visit here and went there on tripadvisor recommendations but they didn't pay it justice. This is by far my favourite part of Singapore for shopping - beats the massive shopping centres!
The street has heaps of charm with really cool artisan, vintage boutiques. Some are a little pricey but most aren't and you won't find the...


Whether its cheaps watches, clothing or food you want, head to the Bugis Street Markets and wander through the back streets. Its amazing!

Bugis was right near our hotel, spent nearly every night there since it is open until 10-11pm.
Wonderful shopping for teens and 20 somethings, especially girls. If you can bargain this is the place for you, as well as an excellent place to pick up souvenirs.
Regarding the "no trying allowed"- ask nicely as they will often let westerners try...


Bugis Street is just what markets should be. Lots of variety and the option to barter if you want. It is even better now than it was a few years ago as they have improved the air circulation which makes it a little more comfortable. You can find just about most things you would want and the only place to...


This is the market which many many people are not aware about..We found this place when we are looking on net for shopping and thought of giving it a try..The market is quite shabby like Ladies market of Hongkong or Patpong of Bangkok,But then shopping for cheap is here...U can scroll about as its a huge market and bargaining at...


If you need to buy clothes for your teens or people back home bugis is the place to go. They do sell souvenirs in bulk like a price for 24 key chains but it works out almost the same as Chinatown.

Extensive markets in and around Bugis Street. Different to other Asian markets elsewhere in that quality was a little better, was air conditioned (to some degree anyway) and no bartering/bargaining. All clothes seemed to be aimed at <30 year olds though...very little for us 50 somethings. One unique and questionable aspect was that you were expected to purchase without trying...


Shopping street it is....... but its mainly for ladies........ So visit only if you plan to shop for women...... again you will get small souveniers and also choclates in here.........

We stayed at the intercontinental so had easy access to Bugis Street. The stalls and shops are open late with a great range of souvenirs. There are plenty of cheap T-shirts, shoes, clothes etc but if you are not interested in the cheap items then just go for the atmosphere. There are also department stores in the immediate vicinity so...


Nice night ambience , just like night market. I wanted to buy I <3 SG t-shirt but it was expensive , S$15 fixed price ! I didnt buy it , I just bought another cloth. And I found that Giordano sells the original I <3 SG t shirt for S$15 too. I was so glad i didnt buy at bugis...


We love Bugis,stay in Sing for 5 days , came here 7 times, I have my first tatoo here, we have been offer really Big promotion when shopping in Bugis+. We are broke now .

It was a bit interesting, but it's very crowded and they mainly sell cheap junk and fakes. made in China", silly statement t-shirts sayng things like "University of Michigan Goldfish", also the ware is quite repetitive. Most of the stuff is "one size fits all", and they don't let you try it, but those sizes are for asians, and looked...


Bugis has always been a place for everyone. The unique fountain entertain the kids, shop as much as you can with better deals or simply hang out to kill your time. We have always had fun enjoying the water fountain, getting wet and watching kids place around.

The place to go for local sites and shopping of all sorts. I go there for the fresh market and rocks and minerals stores

This place is not hard to find ;). If you are a budget-conscious tourist, this is the place for you! This is like 168 shopping plaza in the Philippines where you can find and buy various
things like cheap bags; t-shirts, caps, sun
glasses. Though you could find there some
branded stores also that suits your taste! ;)

This is one of the liveliest and busy shopping area, which I came across. A complete paradise for people who love to shop and bargain. You can find anything and everything here with repeated shops and different variety. A lot of discounts were going on, when I visited and picked up quite a few things for gifting apart from shopping...


A shopping heaven, Bugis Village has everything from clothing, jeans, accessories, even adult shop. Variety of food and drinks also available and

This is the liviest shopping street in Singapore , you can find everything from clothing ,wathes , cosmetics, foods and drinks , frankly speaking almost anything with bargainable price.Its a 4 storey street mall and you all shops from bottom to top have a distictive merchandise.Near to the Bugis Junction , Bugis + shopping mall.Accessible from any part of Singapore...


Interesting places to shop that sells a variety of goods ranging from souvenirs to clothes. Feel free to bargain to get the best price, if you are tired of shopping, there are also a lot of drink and snack vending. Maybe this is a paradise for shopping lovers. Located opposite and close enough to the MRT station, to be able...


If you like market shopping you will be disappointed, if you don't like market shopping don't even bother. Remember they don't open until 10-11 and its the same thing over and over again. Lots of watches, t shirts, hair accessories, and phone cases. There are a lot of food stalls which is probably the only good thing about it.

This is probably one of the very few places in singapore that sells really cheap yet fashionable clothings. However, 70% of the fashion there, is for women and the rest for men. Normal t-shirts, skirts and shorts starts at around $10 and if you are good at scavenging the discount boxes, you can get a really nice sweater at only...


If you like to experience a city "as the locals live" and you like cheap shopping, then this is a good place to go. The whiff of Durian is noticeable at each end, and fried delights are a plenty. If you tire of being surrounded by fellow tourists at the higher-end shopping at Orchard or Marina Bay Sands, this is...


The place is just like Mongkok in Hongkong. Plenty of small stalls that sells souvenir items, tshirts, and accessories. Plenty of food stalls are inside the market place.

nice authentic shops lining the whole street. has very much of a Bangkok feel, with the pushcarts plying their items. can get good deals and special interesting souvenirs here

There are hundreds of stalls, all selling clothes, but every stall has something different to offer. If travelling with wife or girlfriend, be prepared to carry lot of bags :) Oh and yes you can negotiate with them over price

Very lively area.
Bugis is a maze where you can get lost easily but it's a pleasure to get lost in this place.
There is a kind of Atmosphere here.
Lots of things to buy at good price and yo can also bring home souvenir.
If you don't like busy place i recommend you to avoid, in other case go...


Literally hundreds of little stalls in a covered mini-mall across the road from Bugis Junction Mall. I guess much of the merchandise is aimed at tourists (plenty of souvenier shops and the like). At the back there are a number of hawker food stalls which get busy in the evening. Worth a visit to check out if you have a...


Bugis Street, which is located in the Bugis Village area offers a street shopping experience similar to what you can find in Chinatown but it seems there are more stalls here these days. Items are quite similar so if you are short on time, you don't need to visit both Bugis and Chinatown for the street market scene. You can...


Over the years, we have always enjoyed spending a bit of time in the Bugis Village area. The buildings are painted well and there are some lovely staircases (see picture) if you can find the right spots for photography. However, it is the street market and stall shopping that brings you to this area of the city.
The Bugis Village...



A must for anyone looking for some cheap holiday souvenirs to take back home.
There are lots of little shops set out in little streets under cover so no matter what the weather is you can shop away.
We did not stop for food but there is lots available and if it tastes half as good as it looks and...


There are 3 major shopping centres here, BHG, OG n ILLUMA where they sell more good quality products. There have everything from fashion wear , daily necessaries to IT products, anything you can think of, they have it here. At Bugis Village, you can get souvenirs at $2, T-Shirt at 3 for $10, Tote Bag at 4 for $10, Summer...


really good market went there twice. I prefer market shopping than department store and this market had quality clothing and shoes. Cheap watches and jewellry and was able to buy here for everyone back home

We visited this market this morning and whilst is busy and at times congested it is really good for purchasing souvenirs, presents for friends, with a large range of different stores all selling earrings, bags, Jewellery, cheap perfumes, electronic gadgets and accessories, cold juices etc... Really enjoyed buying some souvenirs to take home but you need time out afterwards! Te...


I obviously knew how expensive Singapore would be but was still shocked by the prices. So it was a welcomed surprised stumbling upon the Bugis street market with a variety of clothes, shoes, souvenirs, and other stuff that were more reasonably priced

We spent a couple of hours in these markets and didn't get to see it all. Prices are great. Good quality souvenir t-shirts for $10, or keyrings for $2 (the same they sell elsewhere for $6). If you want to supply your friends and family with souvenirs here is where you can achieve that on a budget. Oh - and...


Refreshing fruit juices available at only $1. Many shops selling clothes (as low as $5), accessories, shoes, souvenirs etc etc. Drop by if you'd like to get cheap souvenirs and clothings.

There are a lot of shopping malls in Singapore but Bugis is where you can find cheap but good finds. It is also near some hawker centers where you can eat authentic Singaporean food at an affordable price (way better than those at malls). Be ready though to walk and face the crazy crowd.

Its a place where you can get cheap and best. Get good souvenir . Bit crowded though.. Its jus outside green line and its very close to purple line as well. Shopping area. Have lots of manicurist and retail shop around.

I wouldnt say this market wasn't anything too exciting if you've done classic markets in other Asian cities yet isn't bad to check out.
We went around 8.45pm to pick up some hawkers food for a late dinner at the same time but a few of the stalls had shut up by then and a large portion of the food...


Take the MRT to Bugis station and check out Bugis Village as I doubt that you would be too disappointed. Busy with many shopping, browsing, eating and drinking options. My fave was grabbing fresh fruit juices at good prices ($1 SGD) or sit down and have a mango smoothie at one of the cafes along the pedestrian strip which afford...


Fortunately we stopped here early afternoon and had a quick walk around the market. The guide books seem to rave about it but it is really tacky with nothing worth buying. Many more interesting places in Singapore.
The one saving grace was that we found a good food court just outside Bugis Street MRT

Had an amazing time shopping in this area. Please explore the whole market before buying anything as they have some amazing variety and some good deals . Do explore the kstree which is just above .

Very huge place for shopping cheap clothes, watches, sovereigner etc
The entire place cannot be covered in a day. BAWARE that the place is really crowded

I have visited the market several times for the buzz. Its always bright and colourful. However, there is nothing in my size - even Asian XL is at best a European L and often only M.

Crazy busy, especially at weekends but good fun. You can buy cheap souvenirs and clothing for next to nothing.

We were advised to visit China Town and Little India, however, after visiting both we weren't that impressed. We then stumbled upon Bugis markets suggested by a local, 3 stories spread over a few streets, great food, great sales and great attraction. The Markets are open all day long and close around 10pm at night, the food stalls carry on...


Spent a fair bit of time at Bugis Street. Certainly if I had an unlimited budget and no clothes I might have found it more interesting but apart from that it was just a nice place to walk through.

Decided to go here after hearing a lot from my friends. Well - for guys - better avoid, its a ladies shopping area and mostly sovereigns. if you are looking for cheap watches and fresh fruit drinks this is the place. Be prepared to face the rush as it gets crowded very soon especially on weekends. With my experience -...


Located in front of Bugis Junction Mall, Bugis street is easily accessible.
you can buy souvenirs and chlotes, bags etc. with a very cheap price.

Since our hotel was located in between Little India and Bugis junction, we got to see both Little India and Bugis Village. I would describe this is more a residential area, where you can buy cheaper clothing, there are many shops and restaurants, also a huge food court that seems to be very inexpensive comparing to few other we visited,...


Went to Bugis village this june school holidays to purchase Vans shoes. As usual, it is quite a good plce to shop and lot of choices to eat.

If you dont want to shop then definitely dont go. Lots of small shops with lots of bargins.
You can also buy food items and other things you may need if you are staying a while.

Fun, full on, busy, frenetic, cheap no major shops just lots of small shops. Better atmosphere that the big sterile malls.
Spent a lot of time wandering around.

what do you do if you're a shopaholic, but on a limited budget in expensive singapore? You go to bugis, of course! Bugis is for shopaholic bargain hunters like me who get their thrills from cheapo finds and who'd sacrifice anything in the shopping--crowds, sweat, you name it! My measly shopping budget would have never survived without bugis. Orchard road...


A nice bargain shopping area worth a look. Theres also a nice chinese cuisine food court across the road.

This was a first time, i visit Bugis Street. SO excited with all the cheap goods. clothes basically are cheap. about 10-30 dollar. depend on the design and material. basically, if you can tolerate cheap goods with average quality of material, you should visit this place. it's not for people who love designer and fancy expensive things. the quality is...


Lots and lots of tiny shops but mostly selling crap and high priced crap save your time don't bother going there.
Hot and smelly

Greta place to buy anything, it's all cheap so don't expect top quality, but it provides value for money. Also has great iced drinks for a $1,as well as food and fruit. This place has been on my Singapore to do list since I first went there in 1976 (changed a bit though!)

Got its name from the Bugis people from Sulawesi, Indonesia. It serve as a trading point of the Bugis, and thats how the name came about. This is flea market or a shopping mecca for all those cheap goods or item like fake watches and women handbags. A good place to get your souvenir for giveway.

Nothing special here. If you're from Jakarta, I could describe it more like "mangga dua". here's a place to shop. Either it's cloth, choco, or just eating food around. Nothing special to show..
Not really recommended for babies, cos it's very crowded... Hot, and none AC..

This is obviously is the most famous recommended shopping area for tourists who are seeking for things to bring back home as a keepsake for their loved-ones. This is the place where you can get tons of Singapore keychains at a very low price (frugal as you may be). TIP: shop around first and go for the lowest deal you...


It is a amazing place to Shop as it is also called the biggest street market of Singapore. This is indeed a shopping paradise for girls as this street offers lots of good merchandise like clothes, dresses, accessories & other gift items with reasonable rates.
It is well connected to MRT, drop down at BUGIS station & 5 minutes walk...


3 floors of shop like markets. Better quality clothing than what is in the markets and lots of cheap dresses for small people like me. Will take you a good couple of hours to work your way around it. Everything is cram packed in, but make sure you barter cos you can oftern get good discounts for multi buys. Just...


It is as beautiful as chaotic, I love Bugis Street, I like his hustle his flea market where it can be found anything and for those like me who love tropical fruit really low prices.
It is not only fruit, but there is really everything, including the dozens of stalls along the way.
This is one of those typical Asian...


This is an area of mix shopping. Value for money for young and trendy, tourist as well as locals. There are many shops around here which you can pick your choices. Food is ample here and it is conveniently next to the Bugis MRT station. Spent at least 3 hours here.

Mostly cheap and low quality clothing. Suitable place to shop for party gear. A lot of touristy stuff on ground floor and low quality snacks and food aligning the pathway.
Really cramp premises and the ventilation is terrible. Almost impossible to navigate during weekends.
Should go to the adjacent mall or Bugis Junction for decent air-conditioning on a hot day...


It is average for shopping.
I expected more but this complex has about 3 storey.
Nothing much if compared to shopping experience in Seoul or Malaysia.
The prices were a bit expensive. Of course if you walk the whole building you will be able to find some cheap stuff as well.
The location is very good near to the subway....


Bustling undercover Market selling lots of touristy tat, worth a visit but don't expect any fakes or it to be like markets in Hong Kong or Thailand.. Spent an hour here just walking through then trying to find my way back to my starting point... it was packed

Bugis Village is a place where you can do shopping for cheap prices compared to other places in Singapore. With a vast and dynamic product mix, Bugis Street is well known for its wide selection, competitive prices and quality merchandise that cater to anyone and everyone.
Bugis Street currently houses about 800 shops, which makes Bugis Street the Largest Street...


A back-alley roadside vendor typed scene where the Bugis from South Sulawesi province, Indonesia would do their trading, in the olden days. This used to be a tourist destination those days during my younger days. Today, popular spot still, against all the bigger and sophisticated malls. As time goes the STB has done a lot to upkeep the place and...


Bugis Street Markets are very hot and crowded. Many stalls all selling the same thing - cheap quality womens clothing and mobile phone accessories. A good place to go for the experience, but if it is shopping you want - there is much better around.

Bugis Street is indeed Singapore's epicentre of (cheap) shopping, and is surely a must-visit.
Depending on where you are, you can take a cab, a bus (double-check the number), or an MRT. From the MRT, you will simply pass through the mall, and cross the street to Bugis/ There you will find many stalls offering various products to choose from:...


There were tons of stalls upon stalls here. It was also ridiculously crowded. It wasn't the cheapest place to go to for souvenirs but it sure was an experience to walk around in.

The ground level of the complex sell souvenirs and delicacies. Prices are a bit cheaper and there are a lot to choose from. The upper floor and the rest is technically a girl's place. Clothes, shoes, bags, u name it! However its not the cheapest market in Asia. Markets in China and Bangkok can let you save more money.

We frequent this place very often and have still not been able to try all of the food and shopping etc. there's so many different things to do here that I'm sure there is something for everyone

Got many stalls you can visit, especially souvenirs, phone casings, or bags! There also got many malls you may shop,go there early morning for the bugis street.

Take your time to go through all the shops in the bugis village and I am sure one can find what they are looking for, at a very cheap price. You can get watches and goggles for as low as $5 and t-shirts starting from $3. IT also has shops that sells items which are over $100 as well. So,...


It is located next to Bugis MRT station, hence the ease of accessibility to the area. The newly renovated bugis village offers great buys at affordable pricing, the improved ventilation makes shopping in the crowded area more comfortable.

Enjoy Bugis Street but do take the time to explore the upper floors of the complex. Down on street level, many of the shops offer the same touristy stuff. Well, that is why we are in Bugis. But, up the levels and the shopping becomes more real. You will spend more money on ground level on touristy things. Upstairs isn't...


If you are looking for bargain shopping of low priced clothes, footwear, knick knacks and accessories, this is the place to be at.
You can also grab a bite or a drink at the food hawker stall inside. Alternatively, a couple of malls also connect the streets and can give you a respite from the crowds and hustle bustle.

Having enjoyed my visit to Central Market in KL, Malaysia, I was looking for something similar in SG where I could buy local goods and souvenirs. Bugis Street is just like any other flea market I've been to in SE Asia, but the prices are more expensive. There are also minimal souvenir items being sold and the area focused more...


It would be a great place for you to stopover so that you can grab some souvenirs in cheap price over here.
I would recommend for the pure fruit juice drink which only costs for SGD1.
Anyway, this place is quite crowded so be alert and keep an eye of your belongings.

many stalls are selling the same merchandise and the quality of the clothes on offer, was quite low. It is good for an hour or so.

If you are looking for good souvenirs as gifts; this is the place. I bought a lot of souvenirs, t-shirts, mobile covers etc from here. As I was staying in China town I realized that almost all of the goods were available in Chinatown at same or cheaper price with better quality, so it's not a must visit or must...


Love the wide array of things you can always find in Bugis Village. It's vibrant and you can just walk and walk. Hop into nearby malls for a greater shopping experience!

Cheap shopping, always crowded especially on weekend. The second floor onward is with air-conditioned, if you dont like sultry, please avoid the ground floor.

If you are looking for aome souvenirs for your friends and relatives back hone than this is the place you could go to look. The price is cheap but dont let down your guard. Some of the vendors still try to scam you off with sayings that their good are made from something which actualy isnt (statue).
Fun place to...


This is a great little market to do all your souvenir shopping. I wouldn't go before noon as not many stalls are open early and would say definately go at night to take in the full atmosphere. There are also great cheap juice and food stalls. The hop on, hop off buses stop here so no excuses for the toursists...


I been in here many times, now is much bigger than a year ago, a lots of shops, restaurants and street market, nice place to go.

It is as beautiful as chaotic, I love Bugis Street, I like his hustle his flea market where it can be found anything and for those like me who love tropical fruit really low prices.
It is not only fruit, but there is really everything, including the dozens of stalls along the way.
This is one of those typical Asian...


This market is a fashion purgatory for all the trash rejected from third world flea markets and dollar stores for blind people. To think that people are such willing participants in this orgy of mass consumerism is one thing, but to imagine designers and factories actually churning out this cr@p in the pursuit of profit truly boggles the mind.
The...


there are so many stuff to purchase, from bags, wallets, shirts, caps, souvenirs, and even pretty dresses! Good quality for the shirts too.

I visit this place almost every week. It has a wide variety of things to buy. I love the clothes, shoes, accessories, etc! Prices are cheap too!

This is a good place to buy souvenirs. There is a wide selection and the prices are reasonable. You can also shop for clothes and apparel. Best time would be around 10am in order to avoid the crowd. Bugis Street is located across the exit from the Bugis MRT station.

Comfortable to walk around, but kinda crowded. affordable stuffs in small kiosks, but very good. I bought a super nice scarf, doubled!

In night time walking on street is good, and for shopping also so many stuff in reasonable price, but bargain there as much as you can. lots of food items also available.

Some great markets at Bugis Street! has everything from t shirts to watch to clothes and jewelry.
Reminds me of some Thailand markets but not quite as cheap!

Good place to go window shopping and buy dresses and some souvenirs like t shirts etc...its really cheap there...can find also lot of local foods like the calamari chips very good taste!!!

Preferred Bugis street over Chinatown. The area is shaded so you can shop here even in the middle of the afternoon but is usually crowded. Alot of good bargains including food / drink stalls.

Most travelers will take the last day to get souvenirs. So please refrain yourself from buying things, in shopping malls, in other attractions etc. You will find all of them here in bugis street with much better price. And more to choose

is the right place to go in Singapore. there is one floore interely devoted to video games, with comfortable sofa and a cinema video for playing with tens of people together. Of courwse you are in Singapore, the fee is 15 dollar for hour. The other floors are just shops like all Singapore

meandering thru Bugis street is an experience in itself.
Must taste the various juices, fruits, pancakes, etc.

not the clean singapore you always run into. a nice market with all kind of trades, embedded in a good looking colonial style building

It was so difficult to move, its very crowded. I don't see any speciality in the stuff they sell. Not really keen to go back. Most of the stuff can be found cheaper in bangkok or in jakarta

As other reviews have noted, this place is primarily known for fast fashions on the cheap. As such, this primarily caters to the teenage crowd with small pockets and a love for trendy items. If you're going with family, give this place a miss especially if you have baby buggies and/or a wheelchair-ed person. The narrow lanes present navigation difficulty,...


After taking a few steps inside we almost turned around again - it was so crowded and busy. But I'm glad we didn't as we ventured upstairs and found some really interesting and (what seemed like) unique pieces like tshirts and dresses.

Bugis at first looks like a rather slum area of Singapore (by comparison of course) but on these busy little streets and within the buildings one can find hundreds of captivating stores and eateries. Out of all the places I visited in Singapore, Bugis felt the most "real". There were "real" citizens here living their day to day lives -...


Looks of great things to buy plenty of places to eat or snack at,casual clothes aplenty,in all sizes.

So you do not want to splurge at Orchard Road? Here is your alternative shopaholics! Shop and eat within your budget.

We had heard about Bugis Street before we went to Singapore so looked it out. The shopping is great and is typical of a large street market in that part of the world, however what stood out for us was the food court. Fantastic food at great prices and provided you go with the flow and enjoy eating at shared...


This is just another mall area with nothing special or original about the shops. The place is very crowded and the corridors narrow.

This place is really for shopping lovers and specially for girls. Lot of variety of clothes with cheap rates. You can buy 3 wrist watches in $10 here and there are lot of other things you can buy in only $10.
You can buy keyrings in bulk here (around 18 pieces in $10).
Shakes drink shops are at every corner....


Is os shopping "China style" but you can not negotiate prices down as much. Like the fact it provides for rainy weather

this place is for girls.you can buy beautiful earring,chunky neckpieces and other nicknacks from here at real low price.you can buy so many stuff for all your girlfriends who ask you,'what have you brought for me':)

Bugis street market was exactly what we were looking for, the perfect place to splurge on cheap last minute clothes and accessories before heading back home, good quality and price, only wish is that it was bigger!!

lots of stalls selling cheap stuff , and the quality is in direct correlation with the prices. it's often hot, stuffy, crowded. probably better off walking at those weekend markets in bangkok than here.

I visited Bugis Street Markets 6 years ago (at night) and this trip visited during the day, I must say go at night - it's cooler and the lights make it more interesting. We went around 11am and most were still shut. I remembered lots of cheap bags (designer look alikes) and could not find any this time around. It's...


i expected far more of the market ..but its full of cheap tee shirts, clothes, handbags etc. The stuff is really very ordinary. I expected it may have electronics, good food etc but no such luck. I would only go if you have time to spare.

Liked the mixture of large fashion stores and mall and small little shops at the Bugis village where you may discover some gems. After shopping, enjoy the good mix of food from different ethnic groups as well.


This is an awesome market which gvies much relief from super costly malls of singapore. The nugis street and market is heaven for cheap shopping. Their are nultiple floors in this market. Here you can buy gifts for your relatives/friends back home. We will get huge variety with items starting as low as $1.
Also outside he market their are...


time to pick up really cheap clothes and bags, remember to bring water and wear shorts cause its really hot...

the place was really teeming with touristy items and of course, the prices were also touristy.... a good place to shop if you have limited time and need to finish your shopping fast... a few items were worth a second look. otherwise, i would rather go to mustafa.

Bugis is great for cheap products in Singapore.
You can get cheap t-shirts and all sorts of 3 for $10 souvenirs of Singapore.
$5 watches are a special! You should buy one for each day. Remember a new battery would cost more than the watch.
Buy cheap, buy lots, go hard!
If you are the late, you still may see...


Come here to find souvenirs at bargain price. and I found purses at cost of 10 SGD for 4. I can't get that in Jakarta. and it's pretty tough purse too. I use it for 1 year now and it doesn't disappoint me at all. for a price like that? I can only say "wow".. Other thing, I love the...


This market may run all day, but it sure fires up at night. There is nothing startling here if you have been to other markets in other Asian cities (eg Hong Kong or in China) but it's quite fun to visit, barter and get amongst it.

if you are looking for souvenirs or cheap designer cloths this is the place to be.
the market has quite a number of shop set up by local designers and the good are value for money, the availability of plus size will be a challenge.
this place is good reasonably priced costume jewellery purchase.

A must return visit to Bugis Village in Singapore...to enjoy once again the atmosphere, food and shopping in an overcrowded market with plenty of street malls and retail outlets in every corner of this popular attaction.
Singapore provides some of the hottest days on earth....and there is very little escape from the heat while walking around Bugis Village...however, keep out...


Being to Singapore couple of time had never been to this place until a friend of mine took me.The whole street stretch is filled up with hawkers selling stuff like toys to t shirts. You name it and this place has it and that too at very cheap price considering Singapore.So right from child to grannies everyone will have something...


For those running on a tight budget, this is the place to go instead of the higher-end Orchard department stores. There's usually something up on sale. Food is also a lot cheaper then in downtown SG. Within the outskirts of Bugis Village, you can also find nice eateries with good food that's reasonably priced. For traveling families, this is a...


Cheaper shopping compared to high end Orchard. Street food available for convenience. Toilets also available. Lots of clothes, bags, souvenirs, and bargaining is also allowed. It's usually extremely crowded and some areas doesn't have air-con. But well, that's Singapore!

Whenever we are in Singapore ,either on a stopover or a holiday itself, we always make sure we wander around the market in Bugis.The hotel that we normally use in Singapore is only a short walk away, so that helps. Although this market has changed a little bit over the years, it is still essentially the same. Teenagers and many...


Bugis Street is an amazing place packed with micro businesses operated largely by very young entrepreneurs. There are about 700 shops in the complex. Make sure you work your way to the 3rd floor for even better prices. Grab a fresh squeezed juice on the ground floor... delicious, to give you the strength to walk all the way through this...


I've been to better markets with more variety. This one is pretty good for the ladies but that's about it.

looking for souvenir and cheap stuff? visit this place. this is my fav stop each time i visit to Singapore. you can bargain for lower price and find a good cheap clothes for street fashion. you can see all the shop on the ground floor's sellig souvenir stuff and on 1st floor and above, you can get a cheaper nice...



Stick to Orchard if you want higher end brands. Plenty of novelty item shops here and its entertaining for a bit to watch kids running around in the fountain.
Other than that, a bit disappointing.

A great place to pick up a bargin, there are so many stalls many selling the same sort of things but well worth haggling. It gets very busy and very hot at night, but not so bad during the day time. Try the street food here, it's very reasonable and very tasty.

Popular place to shop, ladies clothing in particular. The place is always bustling with throngs of young shoppers. And for a change, bargaining is not a NO-NO. Go in with patience, as many shops on different levels sell the same stuff at different prices.
Ideal for shopping on a budget.

Great place for bargains on clothes and accessories! A must visit for teenage girls! What's best is that they're always up to the latest trends! Though I must say, one should scout around first before deciding to buy something as there are several shops selling the same things but at different values

I've always loved visiting Bugis Village for the variety of shops they have there. You can almost find anything there but it's often hot and crowded. If you don't enjoy crowded places, this is certainly not a place to visit.

Dont miss out as this is a great place lots to do and see. Eat local for $3 and its fab deff going back

Atleast cheapest that we found! Considering everything is rather expensive in Singapore, Bugis street was reasonably priced. Its basically a street market - again, well organized. You can get T-shirts from $5 to $25, accessories from $3 to $20, street food and beverages from $1 to $3. Didnt check much more than that

This place seemed at first like a typical Asian night market. Most of the shops seemed to be selling the same items, mobile phone accessories, cheap costume jewelery, hats and bags and clothes that would never fit a westerner. I found that some of the stalls did not want to bargain and I felt that they thought I was a...


Absolutely a must go location visited Bugis Street markets and street markets. The place come to life after 12:00 and is a shopping Mecca for bargain hunters especially women's clothes. Will be coming back again with empty suitcases next time!

This is a good place to shop if you are looking for low price for current fashion. Alot of varities since there are three storeys. You may find the same item with different price across the shop. It is good to make comparison before buying.
It is always crowded. You are not allow to try since it is cheap.

Bugis Street has always been "the" place to shop in Singapore. Probably one of the last areas that haven't been knocked down or removed in the pursuit of progress.
Yes it's crowded, but that's half the fun. This is how visitors to Singapore should see the city. Vibrant, exciting and honest. A market place you can walk through without fear...


the only place i know of in singapore that you can haggle with the vendors.
the clothes are fashionable, cheap and either one-of-a-kind or following the trends. Choose the style you love! There are vintage clothes, cheap funky pieces, something for everyone. Especially for the fashionista who is not attached to the price but style of clothes

Lots of bargain deals for Singapore souvenirs, clothes and food. Interesting undercover street styled shops. Please do look around before buying. Just at the back of the "village" is more interesting places like Kwan In Temple and Rocher thief market. Great place to meet up for backpackers.

Very good place for everything. Also near with bugis street market and having mrt station inside so its very good for the best meeting point

A good place to shop for clothing, shoe, bags and etc. Previously it is only 1 level and now it have expand till 3 level. The item is sell at a reasonable price. We need to be more patience to walk and see each of the items. Maybe the stuff that you are looking for are at one of the...


Whether you want to eat some street food, drink some coolers, shop for nicknacks or eat some of the local food, Bugis has it all under one roof. Nice for an afternoon out since its covered and offers some respite from the heat

The malls has good selections of boutiques and shops. There is a street called Bugis Street selling very cheap clothes watches bags etc. You can bargain for better price.

This is one of my favourite places to go in Singapore. It's close to Arab Street and other attractions but has a more local feel. I love to wander around Bugis Market and eat at Fatty's Restaurant. There is always lots to see and lots of placed to eat and drink. Definitely worth a walk around

This was a pretty average street market experience - very crowded and I didn't see anything particularly unique or amazing on offer. While could certainly purchase souvenirs there if you so desired there wasn't anything particularly uniquely Singaporean about this experience - similar to Paddys Market in Sydney, Camden Markets in London or Takeshita Dori in Tokyo..

This a must see covered market adjacent to a modern shopping mall with lots of knick-knacks for sale. I can't say the items for sale here are different from what you might get from other parts of Singapore. Prices are economical S$5 for a Copy watch. Ended up strolling through the market quite quickly as it is actually quite small.

Bugis street is a bustling market full of clothing shops, watches, jewellery, bags etc. It's good for smaller sized people but if you are a XXL or above, you will have to stick to the department stores. Our teenagers loved the trendy clothes & bags. There are plenty of shoes as well.

My teenage daughter at least could buy some clothing here which she couldn't afford in Orchard rd. there are heaps of shops both indoor and outdoor as well as plenty of f&b's. Not the usual knock offs like petaling st KL. if you're into real shopping and buying, not just looking, come to Bugis. Allow half a day.

Certainly not the best market I have visited, but for cheap deals in Singapore, then this is it. I guess I have been spoilt by the rest of South East Asia with their cheap knock off copies of things. None of that here in Singapore. Also the fashion items seemed to be quite dated as well. I would suggest you...


you will find very cheap stuff here to gift and for personal use dont forget to negotiate at times u get good deals

too many clothing varieties. The best place in town to get Durian. I always visit the vegetarian stalls around the area, as there is a big Guan Yin temple beside. I also shop for cheap groceries in the shop ABC, and Valuebuy at the end of the street, beside the durians.

If shopping at Orchard road malls gets boring or is way out of your budget, go here and you will not even notice the time slipping away. You can find literally everything here - from cheap clothing to souvenirs to interesting novelties. Expect a lot of people inside as the walkway is narrow but this just adds to the whole...


An interesting place for shopping, the kind of shopping that you will not get from Orchard Road. Stalls are located in the streets (hence street market) selling all kinds of cheap stuff. The place usually gets crowded as the night falls.

Pickpockets like squeezy places, don't they? So this is a pickpockets' haven. Be very careful when you come here. Don't get too engrossed in looking at knick knacks. These pickpockets come to Singapore on Social Visit Pass. So they come here, commit petty crimes & disappear in the blink of an eye. No wonder shopkeepers do not bother to report...


A fun part of Singapore to visit if you've not been before. Lots of cheap goods, just what you'd expect from an Asian street market.

if you've missed out on experiencing street side shopping then do visit Bugis market, a place for friendly encounters with locals, meet some really interesting people, tourists, locals, youngsters, making their quick bucks with smart business with crowds of customers walking and window shopping by the evening.

Bugis Street Mall was a 2 minute walk from our hotel so we would constantly return daily and find new things. It is very busy and very big with about 3 levels of stalls selling mainlu clothing, shoes, accessories, bags, perfumes and food. Bags can be found for as low as $10 and jewellery and wallets are usually 3 for...


Great shopping area especislly for small things. So lively and has many small shops in addition to the ones we usually see. Also has s foodcourt.

Spend a few hours at night at the Bugis Street Markets. Lots of gimmicks, clothes and souveniers, real night market feel, cheap purchases. It can be quite narrow between stalls and busy but there is certainly atmosphere.

Bugis Village offers probably the most shopping & eating experiences in such a compact area.
Roughly surrounded by Queen St., Rocher Rd. & Victoria St., it's a series of laneways stuffed full of stalls selling good priced souvenirs, clothing, food, you name it. Night time is probably best as the place bustles with locals out to find good priced items....


We had only one day at Singapore and as we stayed close to the Street, thought of visiting. It is a great place to shop for clothes and accessories and the food street also offers some great choices. Wish we had more time to spend here.

Lots and lots of small shops crammed together selling mostly cheaper clothes, bags, jewellery and souvenirs. Its a bit hard to get around when it is busy but it is worth going through every floor because there will be something that appeals. A lot of the clothes stores don't let you try on the clothes so you either take a...


great finds with great prices. very accessible place, plenty of stores to choose from, cheap deals, great food

Fantastic great vibe nice to spend some time a a real local neighbourhood. Great selection of shops & restaurants.

The place has been bustling with life after the makeover.
It is airconed, clean and organised. though some passageway may be narrow, but that is the price for packing so much thing into a small area.
Store/shops are offering variety and they even has a Korean street selling everything korean. My fav is the humourous tee.

This is my favourite palce to sit, drink coffee and people watch. Lots to do at Bugis and across the road is a good market. on the other side are good restaurants.
It must have been fun in the old days when it was the wildest place in Singapore. Now it is a suburban mall albeit with a bit more...


too crowded but if you're lucky enough you'll find some cheap and good souvenirs here

Good mix of food selection, street shopping and retail shops.

This is the street where selling all sort of cheap stufsf, clothing souvenirs and food. you have to bargain the price, some stalls can't bargain the price where they have the discounted price for the the T shirts. Alight at Bugis MRT and cross the road, you'll see the sign Bugis street.


My kids love Bugis shopping for clothes & what nots etc.Prices are very fair. Nice to get lost just shopping .Fun & friendly.Nice ,delicious fine dining near by .Easy to get there though taxi can be an adventure to get during weekend nights.

This place was hectic on the day we went. People were literally every where and stopping at the stalls for a look was a bit of a mission. In saying that, the stalls were a little repetitive and the prices were not what you would expect from a market. To be honest, I wouldn't go there again and I don't...


Small covered market adjacent to a modern shopping mall. Crowded with lots of knick-knacks for sale. Unfortunately I can't say the items for sale here are different from what you might get from other parts of Singapore. Prices are economical; Orchard Road this is not. I didn't end up buying anything because nothing stood out. Ended up strolling through the...


Great place for tourist to buy souviniers.
Also a great place to walk to nearby attraction ie OG, Singapore's famous, Kuan yin temple and Sim Lim tower (for electronics product).

If you want to shop on a tight budget, bugis is the first place to check. But if you also want branded stores, bugis junction has it. :) This vilage also have moviehaus so no nee to go somewhere else. Bugis aso have wide array of dishes, from the fine dining to the street foods and eat-all-you-can restaurants. Name it,...


I used to live in Singapore for a bit and would come down to buy clothes because they were cheaper and quite fashionable. However my last visit there was completely marred by the change in social landscape - gone were the local students there to earn their allowances, instead it was completely overrun by foreign students and workers keen to...


Such a busy place. You have no idea where one shop / stall starts and the other ends. Every inch of space is used even the corridors are shop fronts.
A contrast to Orchard Road and you should expect it to be busy, at all times.
A good place to pick up some exotic fruits and fruit juices or search...


Interesting to see the traditional buildings (with modern extension) function in a newly created indoor capacity. Good selection of shops and restaurants. Perhaps not worth a trip across town, but worth a stop if you're in the area.

Lots of shops and eatery. Prices of clothes are cheap. Quite a variety of food from Taiwan & China. Somehow, the food is not really cheap.The place is crowded.

Very nice area full of life. Interesting to browse and shop

Bugis is a fabulous place - a freat mix of shopping - clothes, fruits, egg tarts, and lots of knick-knacks all under one roof. Lots of eating places around - including the Arab Street and Haji Lane closeby

This was absolutely our favourite place in Singapore! It was a bustling and lively area with so much to see and eat!! The Bugis food court is highly recommended, it was absolutely huge. A great place to look for cheap bits and pieces or to just enjoy people watching!

I been there few times,it is a good place to shop and buy valueable stuffs, but it is really too crowd there.

You can find anything in Bugis, hahaha... I'm lucky my office is around this area.

Mainly a shopping mall with a few vendors in the centre. It's a lot calmer than the mayhem of the adjoining Bugis market

it was clean, average shops , busy the besy thing was the airconditioning as u walked into the centre as it was so humid outside. i enjoyed having a wander but the shops didnt excite me. everything i can but in england really

Bugis will give you a taste of the youth culture in Singapore.
Busy and fun part of town. GO on Saturday afternoon for the full experience of teenage buying frenzy.
Cheap clothes and goods - Wacky shops.
enjoy!

I walked down Orhard Road and felt that the malls all looked the same and were higher end style shopping. Walked down to Bugis Street and loved it. It was crowded, busy and snaked on endlessly.
Bought some good quality clothes and shirts for men, which seems to be harder to find than womens clothes.
Felt this was more like...



What can I say - well worth a visit to spend your hard earned cash.

Tourist should come here. Best place to shop! There's a wide range of goods here. It's strategic location makes it accessible.

I found nothing interesting here except the shirt with SINGAPORE written in it, that you can buy for souvenir, but the other things is only garbage that sell in over price

shops for fruit, stuff, gift, clothes, and many more. bargaining is very hard in singapore!
but otherwise, this is new experience shopping in market like this.
and also there's a *cough* sex shop. :P

the souvenirs are same price in every shop, expensive, but many nice shape.
easy to get halal food,
some place smell disgusting

This wasn't my first time in Bugis Street. I always enjoy visiting here when I am in Singapore.
Now it has been transformed into a superb indoor market including clothing, tourist souvenirs, fresh fruit, (including durian) & food.
There are some good bargains to be had here, and there is always a good vibe to this place.
Be warned though,...


Bugis Village is the first mall I encounter when getting out of a taxi from Johor Bahru, Malaysia. And that's fine by me. The mall is great with superb shopping and food options. It's also close to lots of other malls. I love Singapore!

There are a lot of shopping malls in this place. Good place to shop.

Not my first time in Bugis Street. Still like to go for souvenirs, local snacks, foods, fruits etc.
It's convenient to go there via MRT. Get off at Bugis station. If you want to go back by taxi, go towards Intercontinental Hotel and there's a taxi stand outside. Just watch how the queue goes. I was at the wrong end...


Air-conditioned street shopping, what else can you ask for? Miles & miles of shops on different levels, affordable, & under an air-conditioned roof. Need I say more?

if you want to try to check out some affordable clothings and other stuff, Bugis area has lots to offer..

Cheap shopping, great for the young ones as well. Well worth a visit.

Bugis village is quite a nice place except for one freaking store " the durian store" beside d fruit store behind bugis st. facing d street near waterloo.. Don't ever ever buy a durian from those con men!!! Me & my husband a local singaporean tried to buy from them & it costs us $S64 for 2kg. First he gave...


Bugis is the ideal shopping paradise for those who can't affort to buy branded but yet hope to get something good but cheap. Recentle there was a lots of store selling clothers from China & Bangkok, the pattern and design are almost the same and not allow to try but due to the price are fairly resonable plaese don't mind...


Definitely worth a visit if you are wanting to do some shopping that doesn't cost an arm and a leg. this is where you will find imitation watches etc and cheap little toys etc

Many shops, cafes, Hop on /Hop off bus stop, 7/11 shops and etc. MRT is close, supermarkets are available, everything you can find at this place.

I think Bugis Street is the only place in Singapore which provide cheapest t-shirts, handbags, fridge magnets (3 items for only SGD 10) and it also has many adult material shops. Other than walk from MRT Bugis station and Bugis Junction mall, you can also walk through behind Bencoolen street (straight from Sim Lim Square).
Another thing, in the morning,...


If i had not visited this place,i would have not completed the Shopping experience and the list of items i had. This place was a heaven for me because i was in desperate need of buying stainless steal rings for men,both fancy and simple and i had not been able to find them in Dubai or Malaysia. The best thing...


Bugis is not the same as it was in the 60's, a vibrant life good food, open areas and fun to sit and people watch, this is all gone to the same junk that can be purchased in any side road cheap store, only in Bugis the prices are higher.

it has a blend of buddhist temple on the street and high tech sim lim building

Very crowded and narrow market but well worth a visit even though Singapore is not cheap anymore.

Packed out like sardines in a slowly moving tin. Take a good ground anchor if you want to stop and look at the traders gear. In summary its cheap souvenir stuff i.e. a snow dome of Singapore, yes i did buy one.

bugis village is full of variety of shops.... non stop shopping can be done over there....

I like shopping here because it is the only place I have been able to bargain! The experience is more like shopping at a market, which is a nice change from the malls. The quality is not the best but the prices are not high and it is a nice experience.

Good place to find bargains I supposed..I'd go for food and nothing else

In1967/69 Bugis street was the night-time haunt of transvestites, but all that has changed.
Now it has been transformed into a superb indoor market..
Clothing , tourist souvenirs, fresh fruit ( including the evil-smelling but delicious durian
& food.
Everything is reasonably priced, but a little haggling does not go amiss.
My wife (like most women) loves to shop &...


When talking about budget shopping, Bugis is a popular choice for most people. But for me, it was not much fun. The style of the clothes were not so great... Somehow, I keep comparing it to TST in HK, and I had better picks there.
For SG shirts to bring home as souvenirs, the prices are cheap, similar to Chinatown,...


The market stalls may not have much for sale that is of interest but the buzz and atmosphere just has to be experienced. Cross Queens Street to Albert Street for more, crowds, market stalls and the Sri Krishnan Temple in Waterloo Street.

The shopping experience here is no more decided by the weather. You could stroll along the street and a lot of stall around selling all kinds of merchandise. From food to clothing. Saloon to souvenir shop. The whole street is shelted and best of it is aircondirioned. In regards to the pricing, I have no comments as not a fans...


So many stalls in this crazy mall! It's so much fun to walk through the crammed together mini stores, selling everything from dresses and shoes to juices and cakes. Feels like Asia - whereas the other malls feel like North America! Both are fun to explore.

A melting pot of boutiques catering to the mid tier shoppers and shoppers looking for a good bargain. After a good walk, there are a variety of restaurants waiting for patrons

You can find stalls selllng almost anything in Bugis Street Market, but don't come here if you are in a rush. It's usually very busy and it's best to just "go with the flow". Cheap souvenirs, food and clothing are the main products on sale.

Bugis Square, Village & Street all combine to make Bugis a place where people come and meet. Whether travelling, shopping or just socialising, this is the place many Singaporians and Tourists want to be.

Cheap buys, you can bargain a little for the knicknacks and clothes.

If you can't afford Orchard Road and want to see where the locals shop, try it.
Nearby a MRT stop
Nearby the Causeway Link buses

This is a great place to go for good food, fresh markets, and shopping. Must see in Singapore!

Go deep into Bugis Village for cheaper buys! There's a corner stall with really good blogshop-style pieces at SGD$10-15. Pretty awesome for the money savvy!

the once colorfully local market for cheaper clothings and nik-naks have took a turn and you could hardly find one who speaks like a local there. Infested with immigrants and overstayers from Mainland China, it is nonetheless a little Shenzhen in the making.

This area have three section into open market, large food court and a temple. Open market sell product most come from China, much expensive then othe asia city like Bangkok. Food court have many choice to eat and drink, very nice but hot (open area). Temple is beautiful and must visit.

The first time I visited it was on a Sunday and there was a special and colorful Chinese New Year's market. The second time was on a night tour where there was good shopping.

I find it simply boring. Apparels here are so expensive and not fashionable. Probably suitable those secondary sch students..Tourist do not even think of coming here to get anything

Plenty of shops, selling clothes, shoes, foodstuff, souvenirs. Liked the stalls selling fresh fruit juices, you can get one for just S$1!

This place is alot like Chatuchak (JJ) market in Bangkok - small little cubby hole stalls with cheap clothing, bags, belts, etc. Worth a look and you can get some good bargains (but with items priced low like this, realistically, they aren't of very good quality). A bit hot and very very crowded (watch your purses and pockets).

Loads of people. Loads of small stalls selling tee-shirts. Yes, its a tourist-trap but somehow, the chaos here is quite welcomed when everything else is too orderly.

not known to many tourists.
its one of the largest street shopping area in Singapore.
there you can find a huge range of shops selling all kinds of clothes, shoes, bags, gifts etc etc. there are street food vendors as well where you can get the Singapore taste!

If you like markets this is for you lots to look at lots to buy, train to Bugis station and it s right there.

We had a great shop at Bugis Street. You can shop for affordable bags, earrings, shirts, souvenirs, etc. It'll be a busy place with many people.

We always go to Bugis street in every visit to Singapore. Because we, King of fruit Durian's Lovers, can get the best variant and low prices of this fruit. Only S$ 2 for small size box and S$ 5 for medium size box. Its location is also adjacent to the Bugis MRT station and Bugis Junction Mall.
Here are many...


not like discussed the famous Bugis street for central typical souvenir items Singapore. The market is crowded with local goods and cheap. Most of the clothes and selling replica watches, the price is not cheaper than Lucky Plaza on Orchard Rd.
And food courtnya also somewhat shabby and crowded, merchants of all Chinese. Difficult to understand and sometimes a small...


Bugis street has an enclosed flea market setup. Getting there by MRT should be the easiest. Alight at the Bugis station - situated on the East-West (Green) line - and follow the signboards to Bugis junction. "Bugis junction" is at a exit of the MRT. "Bugis street" is right across the street from there. We went on a Thursday morning...

The stuff that we found here was quite similar to Mong Kok Ladies Market in Hong Kong .
The best part was - You dont need to bargain like crazy to buy same stuff here in Bugis .
We had a good time there...

There's nowhere else in Singapore to shop cheap things other than Bugis!
I got a quarter of my clothings from here. it is a fashion paradise. You can spend the whole day here. Try not to go in the day cause it is quite hot but in the night it will be jampacked with people, so crowded, you'd get separated...


a lot of good bargains. good place to buy souvenir. but you have to take note that the place is always packed with loads of shopper,most of the area is not airconditioned so it's not for picky buyers.

You can buy good funky stuff in very cheap prices , do watchout the collection of shoes tat all the shops have , you also find gr8 deals in all clothes jwellery... Do check out this market for a gr8 collection of souviners

Similar to Harajuku in Tokyo. The Bugis village is great for shopping, find cheap stuff in the otherwise not too cheap Singapore and for people watching. All the youngsters flock here after school or uni to chill, goto movies, play pool, etc...In addition all the cheap places to eat, flea markets are great.

A crowded ally connecting temples and technoligy shops to the train station / Bugis shopping centre. Gets very hot and crowded but if you want cheap tourist t-shirts it is the place to go.

Bugis Street is a collection of separate stalls offering a wide variety of touristic trinkets, quirky fashion, shoes, T shirts, accessories. Some of it is cheap and cheerful others, some of its funky, you can find some racier stuff, Bugis was a notorious red light area once and you can also find things a bit more expensive.
A lot of...


Bugis Street is 'The' place in Singapore where you can find some cheap shopping, which otherwise is not possible in the super cosmo Island nation.
But in case anyone is planning to hop on to KL or Bangkok, I would surely recommend to save your bucks for these cities, as the Bugis street stuff would be available for less than...


probably the only market in Singapore which can boast of prices like this ..t-shirts ,funky dress materials , handbags ,fridge magnets and even an adult shop also .. Hand bags was a steal ... one can reach here by getting off bugis mrt or from the other side through albert road

Looking for souvenirs? Just go there and find anything you like below S$10. T-Shirt, key chains, wallet, hat you name it, at affordable price.

Very clean, best fresh fruit smoothies ever. Choice of all sorts to eat.Great buzz in the evenings. Found a bakery in the street mall outside that sells REAL coffee and delicious pastries

Cheap and fashionable clothes imported from korea, china and japan. You can get all kinds of cool clothes and cosplay outfits like sailor fuku, gothic lolita, punk and korean chic and shibuya gyaru fashion. All way way cheaper.

located in Bugis Village, in front of Bugis Junction. If you take off from Bugis MRT, you have to croos the road and you are already in front of Bugis street with red sign. There always crowd with peoples, shops selling foods, sorvenirs, and fashions. There are lot of shops selling sorvenirs but some selling quite cheaper. If you bought...


Where you can find the cheapest key chains or magnets as souvenirs. They are open until 11 pm. Behind the market, it is interesting to see Buddhist and Hindu temple side by side!

Full of people and wider choice of cloths.... You'll enjoy the walk down to the street

A flea market kind of set-up with stalls or stores selling variety of souvenirs, t-shirts, clothes, shoes n other knick-knicks. Cater more towards young-ish people. Its kind of fun just browsing around thru' the narrow alleys. Some good buys for those on a budget. Don't expect quality stuffs, but hey, if u are looking for branded stuffs go to Orchard...


cheap shopping, but you get what you pay for. if you are $ over quality then this is will be a shopping heaven for you.

If any one of you out there is not interested in LV, Prada, Gucci, Hugo Boss, CK and all other BIG names, you may head down to Bugis Village. Alight at Bugis MRT, cross road at Victoria Street and you will be presented with three floors of shopping fever. Everything that you need on a daily basis, you can find...
